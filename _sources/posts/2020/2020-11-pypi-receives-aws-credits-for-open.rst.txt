PyPI receives AWS credits for open source projects
==================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/11/pypi-receives-aws-credits-for-open.html>`_.

 The support provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to the Python Software
Foundation has been a core part of operating `The Python Package
Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ since it was relaunched on an all new codebase in
`March 2018 <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/03/warehouse-all-new-pypi-is-
now-in-beta.html>`_.

AWS has provided PyPI a stable and extensible platform for our Kubernetes
based deployment. Services like Amazon RDS, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon
Elasticsearch Service, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS have made managing the
service behind PyPI possible with such a small team.

The PSF and PyPI team are excited transition from credits negotiated as part
of sponsorship deals to credits granted through the `AWS promotional credits
for open source projects <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-
promotional-credits-open-source-projects/>`_ program.

This kind of direct support to open source infrastructure projects is rare and
we are happy to see AWS investing in not only the Python community, but the
broader open source ecosystem it is built on as well.
