PSF is hiring: Director of Resource Development
===============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/12/psf-is-hiring-director-of-resource.html>`_.

The PSF is seeking to hire a Director of Resource Development to spearhead
fundraising and sponsorship efforts! We are accepting resumes through January
14th, 2021. See the job description section below for more information.

After 5 years, our sponsorship coordinator, Betsy Waliszewski, is beginning
her transition towards retirement. Betsy has been an incredible help to the
PSF and the Python community. Our goal is for Betsy to work with the new hire
for a dedicated time in Q1. Additionally, Betsy will continue helping with
administrative tasks in the first half of 2021 in a part-time capacity. We
wish Betsy the best as she begins a new chapter beyond the PSF!

Taking into consideration Betsy's retirement and the financial impact of 2020
and 2021, the PSF's need for this role is now greater than ever. We look
forward to reading the resumes that come in!
