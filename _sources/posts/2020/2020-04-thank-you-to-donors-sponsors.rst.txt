Thank you to donors & sponsors
==============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/04/thank-you-to-donors-sponsors.html>`_.

PyCon 2020 in Pittsburgh, PA `was
cancelled <https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/pycon-us-2020-in-
pittsburgh.html>`_ due to COVID-19 and that impacted the PSF's finances. `Our
blog from March 31st <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/psfs-
projected-2020-financial-outcome.html>`_ estimated that the PSF would need to
use $627,000 of its financial reserve to get through 2020.  
  
Since the time we cancelled PyCon 2020, the PSF staff and PyCon volunteers
have been working on PyCon 2020 Online, which is launching April 15
(`subscribe here <https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/>`_ to get the content launch
emails)!  
  
During our planning process, we have seen an overwhelming amount of support
from sponsors and registrants.  
  
Over 40 sponsors have agreed to participate in PyCon 2020 Online and 418
individuals donated and/or converted their registration fees to donations.

Thank you individual donors!
----------------------------

Thank you to the individuals that donated to the PSF as they registered for
PyCon. Thank you to those that converted part or all of their PyCon
registration fees into PSF donations. Thank you to the messages and tweets of
support. Our hearts are full and our eyes are teary from the tremendous
generosity we have seen.

  
  



Thank you sponsors!

Thank you to the sponsors that are participating in PyCon 2020 Online. Thank
you to the organizations that stepped up from the beginning to stand by PyCon
regardless. Thank you to the sponsors that checked-in on our staff throughout
the process as well. Seeing those emails and being on calls with you all
lifted our spirits in a very stressful time. Every video we put online will
have this slide inserted because none of this could be possible with out these
organizations:

Update on financial impact
--------------------------

Thanks to generosity of individual and corporate donors and decreasing PyCon
2020 expenses, we estimate that the PSF will now only need $141,713 from its
financial reserve to get through 2020.  That is 77% better than what we
initially anticipated!  
  
  
In the coming month, the PSF will reassess its strategic goals for the coming
year. Even though we will have to reevaluate taking on new projects, our team
is going to work diligently to get the PSF back on track!
