Rebuilding the PSF Fundraiser 2020 - Your support means so much ðŸ¤—!
==================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/12/rebuilding-psf-fundraiser-2020-your.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation launched its `end-of-the-year
fundraiser <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2020-q42020-drive/>`_ on
December 1st and the response has been overwhelming ðŸ’™ðŸ’›. Even in this difficult
time, our community has come together to help the PSF in its efforts to
support Python development and to grow a diverse and international community
of Python programmers.

In 2019, the strategic plan for the PSF shifted towards supporting CPython
sustainability. With lower expected income from PyCon US for two years, we
need donation and sponsorship support to make these plans a reality.

As of Dec 17th, our fundraiser has generated over $52,000 in donations and
there are still almost 2 weeks to go. If you haven't yet
`donated <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2020-q42020-drive/>`_, there are
several ways you can help:

  * You can purchase a product/service from any of the below companies and part of the proceeds will go to the PSF. Click on the infographics below to see the offers.
  * Donate directly to the PSF! No purchase is necessary to participate in the fundraiser. You can `donate directly here  <https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=31>`_so that 100% of your donation goes to the PSF.
  * A number of individuals are offering to match donations to the PSF, see `matcher.pyfound.org <http://matcher.pyfound.org>`_ for more information.

If you have already donated, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. If
`donating  <https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=31>`_is
not an option, helping to spread the word about the fundraiser would be
greatly appreciated.
