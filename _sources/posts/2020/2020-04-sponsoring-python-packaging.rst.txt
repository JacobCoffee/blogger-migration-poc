Announcing a new Sponsorship Program for Python Packaging
=========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/04/sponsoring-python-packaging.html>`_.

The `Packaging Working Group <https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG>`_ of the
`Python Software Foundation <https://python.org/psf-landing/>`_ is launching an
all-new sponsorship program to sustain and improve Python's packaging
ecosystem. Funds raised through this program will go directly towards
improving the `tools <https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/>`_ that your
company uses every day and sustaining the continued operation of the `Python
Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_.

With this program we are asking companies that rely on Python, its ecosystem
of packaging tools, and PyPI to help us build a dependable basis to continue
our efforts.

Improving the packaging ecosystem
---------------------------------

Since 2017, the Packaging Working Group has secured
`multiple <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-awarded-moss-grant-
pypi.html>`_ `grants <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/12/moss-czi-support-
pip.html>`_, `completed one
contract <https://www.opentech.fund/results/supported-projects/pypi-
improvements/>`_, and received a `generous
gift <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/an-update-pypi-funded-work.html>`_
\-- all with the goal of improving the Python packaging ecosystem for all
users. Most of these projects were funded by not-for-profit organizations and
all of them were one-time awards with specific objectives.

Results from these funded projects include:

  * The successful relaunch of the Python Package Index, powered by the new 'Warehouse' codebase in 2018
  * Adding security features to PyPI, including two-factor authentication in 2019
  * Improving PyPI's web interface for users with disabilities and adding support for multiple locales in 2019
  * Additional security-focused features for PyPI in 2019 and 2020
  * Overhauling pip's user experience and dependency resolver in 2020

Companies have asked us how they can help fund the platform they depend on.
With this new sponsorship program, the Working Group can sustainably `fund
packaging
improvements <https://wiki.python.org/psf/Fundable%20Packaging%20Improvements>`_
not directed by a specific grant or contract and benefit millions of Python
users around the world. Greater budget flexibility and a deeper reserve will
help us invest in what the community needs.

Sustaining PyPI
---------------

As of April 2020, the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ responds to
800 million requests and delivers 200 million packages totalling 400
terabytes, during the typical day. Our users include hobbyists, scientists,
companies, students, governments, nonprofits, and more.

`Existing sponsors <https://pypi.org/sponsors/>`_ donate their services, which
keeps PyPI free to users and to the PSF, aside from a subset of one staff
member's time. Without these donations, the costs to operate PyPI each month
would be staggering.

These critical service donations must not be taken for granted. Sponsoring the
Packaging Working Group through this new program creates and maintains a
stable reserve. We'll need that reserve in the event that we lose any of these
in-kind service donations and must pay some or all of PyPI's operating costs.

Show your support!
------------------

As a company, your team can review the details of this new sponsorship program
