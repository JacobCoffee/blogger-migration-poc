Announcing the PSF Diversity and Inclusion Work Group
=====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/12/announcing-psf-diversity-and-inclusion.html>`_.

Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world,
meaning that along with this growth the Python community has continued to
expand, in every continent around the globe. While this growth has been
exciting, it has also brought new challenges and opportunities to improve our
global community. In order to further the PSF’s
`mission <https://www.python.org/psf/mission/>`_ to ‘support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers’, the
Python Software Foundation is excited to announce the launch of the` Diversity
and Inclusion Workgroup <https://wiki.python.org/psf/DiversityandInclusionWG>`_
(hereby referred to as the D&I workgroup). The D&I workgroup will help own
this important work, as well as provide guidance to the PSF Board of Directors
in line with this mandate.

  

Throughout 2020 the PSF and PSF Board engaged the community in a discussion
about board election reform. Many members voiced concerns over the lack of
geographical representation on the Board. Given the prior conversations the
Board has had about how to better support our international community members
and the feedback collected throughout 2020, the D&I workgroup was created.
Ultimately, the D&I workgroup will help advise on how to increase diversity
and inclusion on a global scale in the Python community. Whether it’s
supporting international users, improving board representation or increasing
core development mentorship, this group will proactively engage with the
community and PSF leadership to achieve this larger goal.

  

D&I Workgroup membership

The D&I workgroup will initially focus on geographical diversity. We are aware
that diversity and inclusion is multi-faceted and must address issues beyond
geography. As the workgroup becomes more established, its mandate and
membership will broaden as well.

With this purpose in mind, the Board has recruited Python community members
from every continent - minus Antarctica - in the world. Our members will
advocate for and provide insights on behalf of their local communities as best
they can, and the workgroup will be chaired by PSF Director Marlene Mhangami.
Below is the list of initial members:

  * Anna Ossowski (United Kingdom/Germany)

Goals of the D&I Workgroup

The Workgroup will pursue its goals in several ways including:

  1. Communicating and collecting feedback from the Python community to understand how the PSF can better serve and grow a diverse membership. 

  2. Measuring, evaluating, and sharing the PSF’s progress towards its diversity initiatives on a regular basis

  3. Discussing policy, initiatives and grant proposals to recommend to the PSF Board of Directors in line with the group’s purpose. 

  4. Recruiting members that will advocate for and provide insights on behalf of their local communities and groups. 

We need your help!

For more details about the D&I workgroup (e.g. how it will function & report
feedback, values) our full charter is available
`here <https://wiki.python.org/psf/DiversityandInclusionWG>`_. We are also
asking for feedback from the community on your thoughts about diversity and
inclusion. Please take a few minutes to fill out `this
form <https://forms.gle/uurCoBz6u6hKb964A>`_. The community can expect ongoing
reports as part of our commitment to transparency. If you would like to reach
out to the workgroup directly with any questions, ideas, or thoughts please
email `diversity-inclusion-wg@python.org <mailto:diversity-inclusion-
wg@python.org>`_. If you would like to become a member of the workgroup, please
send us an email expressing your interest. We will begin to review new
applications for membership in the first quarter of 2021.

We are excited about supporting the global Python community in new and
creative ways. The D&I workgroup is only able to do this work with the help of
the Python Software Foundation. Currently, the PSF is running a fundraiser to
raise $60,000 USD by December 31st. Pythonistas can get discounted offers on
products and services to level up their Python knowledge, and help the PSF
raise funds at the same time! Visit the fundraiser `home
page <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2020-q42020-drive/>`_ to see more
details or read more on the `blog <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/12/help-
psf-raise-60000-usd-by-december.html>`_.

Thank you for being part of our community!
