Key generation and signing ceremony for PyPI
============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/10/key-generation-and-signing-ceremony-for.html>`_.

On Friday October 30th at 11:15 AM EDT the Python Software Foundation will be
live streaming a remote key generation and signing ceremony to bootstrap `The
Update Framework <https://theupdateframework.io/>`_ for `The Python Package
Index <https://pypi.org/>`_. You can click
`here <https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=PSF+TUF+key+generation+and+signing+ceremony&iso=20201030T1115&p1=179>`_
to see what time this is in your local timezone.

This ceremony is one of the first practical steps in deploying `The Update
Framework <https://theupdateframework.io/>`_ to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ per
`PEP 458 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/>`_.

The Python Software Foundation Director of Infrastructure, Ernest W. Durbin
III, and Trail of Bits Senior Security Engineer, William Woodruff, will be
executing the runbook developed at https://github.com/psf/psf-tuf-runbook.

For transparency purposes a live stream will be hosted from the `Python
Software Foundation's YouTube
channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAVDPguRzqHySnZw64CcOg>`_. Please
subscribe to the channel to be notified when the stream is live if you'd like
to follow along.

Additionally the recording will be archived on the `Python Software
Foundation's YouTube
channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAVDPguRzqHySnZw64CcOg>`_.

This work is being funded by `Facebook Research <https://research.fb.com/>`_ and
was originally announced in `late
2018 <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/12/upcoming-pypi-improvements-
for-2019.html>`_ and a portion of it commenced in 2019 while awaiting PEP 458's
acceptance. With PEP 458 in place `we announced that work would commence in
March <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/an-update-pypi-funded-work.html>`_.

We appreciate the patience and contributions of the community, `Facebook
Research <https://research.fb.com/>`_, and `Trail of
Bits <https://www.trailofbits.com/>`_ in seeing through the implementation of
PEP 458.

Additionally volunteers from `The Secure Systems Lab at
NYU <https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/>`_, `Datadog <https://datadoghq.com/>`_, and
`VMWare <https://www.vmware.com/>`_ have helped to develop the implementation
for PyPI but have begun work on client implementations to verify the results
in `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.
