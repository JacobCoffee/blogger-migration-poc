The Python Software Foundation re-opens its Grants Program!
===========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-python-software-foundation-re-opens.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is excited to announce the re-opening of its
Grants Program!

The pandemic negatively affected the PSF’s finances with the cancellation of
PyCon 2020’s in-person conference and lower donations. Thanks to PyCon 2020
Online sponsors, donors, and our financial reserve, we are able to continue to
support the Python community!

Historical Impact
-----------------

The PSF’s Grants Program has supported the growth of Python in many regions
and fostered the training for many individuals. Between 2014 and 2019, the PSF
disbursed *$1,637,000*  in financial support to organizers and developers
all over the world.

Updated criteria & requirements
-------------------------------

For the immediate future, the PSF’s Grants Program will focus on virtual
sprints, virtual events, and Python core development support. We are not
currently accepting applications for in-person events. When that changes, we
will update the community.

Here's an abbreviated overview of what the PSF Grants Work Group requires:

  * *For all applications* : at least 6 weeks to review the application; so if your virtual sprint begins November 1st, submit your application no later than September 21. We also require a code of conduct.
  * *For virtual workshops & training*: a detailed curriculum, a budget overview, and mentor information
  * *For virtual conferences* : a schedule, a budget overview, sponsor information, and registration procedures
  * *For dev projects/sprints* : milestone breakdowns with a timeline, and a budget overview

Be sure to read through the Grants Program information page and FAQ page
before submitting your grant application to capture all the requirements and
changes:

<https://www.python.org/psf/grants/>

<https://www.python.org/psf/grants/faq/>

The PSF has put together a `free resource list for virtual
events <https://www.python.org/psf/grants/free-resources/>`_. Some of these may
help reduce the cost of your virtual event. We recommend that you read this
page before submitting a grant application.

Information on how to submit a grant application can be found on our
`website <https://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_.
