================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/12/help-psf-raise-60000-usd-by-december.html>`_.

Help us raise $60,000 USD by December 31st!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python continues to be a popular and accessible language in the education
sector. More and more institutions around the world are introducing students
to the opportunities that Python presents. Your support can spread that reach
even further.

The theme of our `fundraiser
 <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2020-q42020-drive/>`_this year is geared
toward education. We're excited to collaborate with authors, trainers, and
companies that offer their services all over the world to raise money for the
PSF. In addition, it will help grow a diverse and international community of
Python programmers.

Pythonistas can get discounted offers on products and services to level up
their Python knowledge, and help the PSF raise funds at the same time! Visit
the fundraiser `home page
 <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2020-q42020-drive/>`_to see more details
or click on the logos below to see individual offers.

Financial Impacts of 2020 and 2021
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

COVID-19 has changed all aspects of our lives and is reshaping our future.
PyCon US typically generates over 65% of the PSFâ€™s revenue. With PyCon US 2020
and 2021 happening virtually, the PSF may lose $1.2 million USD of expected
revenue for those two years.

In 2019, the strategic plan for the PSF shifted towards supporting CPython
sustainability with plans to hire three full time Pythonistas to address
maintenance, R&D, and education. With lower expected income from PyCon US for
two years, we need sponsorship support to make these plans a reality. Other
2020 plans put on hold include improving pypi.org support and continuing more
grants program funding.

The PSF is researching ways we can diversify our revenue streams, but cannot
replace the near-term loss of $1.2 million USD. Your support is more important
than ever! Read more about what  the PSF has been up to
`here <https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/prospectus/2021/>`_.
