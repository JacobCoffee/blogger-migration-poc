The Python Language Summit is a small gathering of Python language
implementers (both the core developers of CPython and alternative Pythons), as
well third-party library authors and other Python community members. The
Summit features short presentations followed by group discussions. In 2020,
the Summit was held over two days by videoconference; questions were asked by
a combination of voice and chat. It was led by Łukasz Langa and Mariatta
Wijaya.  
  
Thanks to `MongoDB <https://mongodb.com/>`_ for sponsoring the Python Language
Summit.
