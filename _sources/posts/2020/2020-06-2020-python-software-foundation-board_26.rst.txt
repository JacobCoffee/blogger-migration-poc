2020 Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election Retrospective and Next Steps
========================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/06/2020-python-software-foundation-board_26.html>`_.

With the `2020 Board of Directors Election
Results <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/06/2020-python-software-foundation-
board.html>`_ announced, a new class of directors will officially be joining
June 30th!

In light of the results and narrow margins, the Python Software Foundation
(PSF) staff, incoming directors, existing directors, and community have
already taken time to consider and `discuss <https://discuss.python.org/t/psf-
board-election-reform/4527>`_ the participation and representation of our global
community on the PSF Board of Directors. These facets are crucial to the long
term direction and resilience of our community.

For now, the PSF staff would like to share information on *participation* ,
*representation* , and the *next steps  *we plan to take to improve these
facets of our membership.

section.

Voter Disenfranchisement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the process of administering this year's election we realized that 114 of
1151 voters were initially disenfranchised from this year's vote. In addition
we were able to confirm that approximately the same number were
disenfranchised from the 2019 vote due to the same issue.

While researching a missing ballot the election administrator discovered that
a large number of Supporting members were missing from the 2020 voter roll.

When pulling information for Supporting members from our relationship
management platform, we erred in overlooking that "Supporting with Yearly
Renewal" memberships were not included when querying for "Supporting"
memberships.

This excluded 125 members from our result and thus the voter roll. 11 of those
members were already represented in other membership classes (Fellow,
Contributing, Managing). The result was 114 disenfranchised voters.

For past years, we'll be working to retroactively to understand how long this
has been affecting the voter roll. We've requested the voter rolls from past
elections from the previous volunteer Election Administrator and will share
analysis when we are able.

For 2020, ballots were issued for those voters 2 days into voting, and email
notifications and reminders were sent so that they had a chance to vote, and
have their votes counted. We have also updated our voter roll report and
documentation to correctly query for all Supporting members moving forward.

Representation
--------------

After the results were published, an immediate question raised was "what do
the demographics of our members and voters look like?".

This is not a new question among the PSF staff, directors, or community, but
was particularly impassioned this year due to the extremely close margins.
Especially given that the winning candidates (unlike the candidate pool) all
reside in North America and Western Europe.

Bluntly, we do not have the data needed to answer this question accurately.
Currently the only membership class we have any demographic information for is
Supporting members, who constitute less than 25% of the voter roll, and that
only includes their postal address.

Next steps
----------

The PSF staff have already begun to discuss and formulate plans around the
following:

Short term: Improved demographic information in Member profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PSF staff and board understand that demographic information is highly
sensitive and should not be needlessly collected. We are currently discussing
and making plans for what demographic information may be added to membership
profiles and if specific pieces of information will be voluntary or required.

Demographic information such as country of residence, years of experience with
Python, and years of participation with the PSF will allow for us to better
understand how the board represents our global membership. Most importantly it
will allow us to track progress towards our goal to best represent our
community over time.

Medium term: Consolidating membership management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Members may not realize that each membership class is currently managed in a
set of disparate systems and processes:

  * Basic members sign up at python.org
  * Supporting members donate at psfmember.org to sign up
  * Contributing and Managing members submit their certification via a Google form
  * Fellows are manually managed by PSF staff on psfmember.org.

This regularly leads to headaches and confusion for _everyone_  involved.

The PSF staff was planning to migrate to a new relationship management
platform in 2020, but had to abandon this effort due to the financial outlook
in the aftermath of the cancellation of PyCon 2020. Instead, we have renewed
efforts to invest in our existing platform, CiviCRM. This will include
consolidating all membership signups and management in one place:
psfmember.org.

We hope that this will also improve the experience for new and existing
members and empower the PSF staff to better answer questions about our members
as a whole.

Long term: Reconsidering membership classes and benefits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ideas for how we can best welcome members as well as any and all Python users
globally are also being discussed and researched by the PSF staff. We will be
assessing what barriers exist for new members and what helps to drive and
retain participation of existing members. This process may include bylaws
changes and user research. We hope to be able to share a timeline for this
work as it develops.

Summary
-------

We are grateful as an organization for each and every member of our community
past, present, and future. We are excited to see the field for the board
expanding to better represent our global community. We look forward to doing
the work necessary to improve the membership experience of the Python Software
Foundation and will be sharing more information over the coming months as the
PSF staff and board better develop plans.
