Python Developers Survey 2019 Results
=====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/05/python-developers-survey-2019-results.html>`_.

We are excited to share the results of the third official Python Developers
Survey conducted by the Python Software Foundation with the help of JetBrains.

More than 24,000 Python users from over 150 countries took part in the survey
this past November. With the help of the data collected, we are able to
present the summarized results, identify the latest trends, and create a
Python developer profile.

2019! <https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/>`_

The survey results cover a broad list of topics. Some of the key things you
may learn from the report include: main motivations for Python usage, current
popular frameworks, libraries, tools and languages, and many other insights.

In all likelihood, there are plenty of potential findings that were not
included in the report. If you have specific questions that are unanswered,
[send them to us]() and we’ll dig into the data for additional analysis. You
also have the opportunity to delve deeper into the `raw survey
data <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GW86M_QLFOA2KyeWeb8hzBj_RqQIXmAU>`_
and uncover your own amazing facts.

We’ll be delighted to learn about your findings! Please share them on Twitter
or other social media, mentioning `@jetbrains <https://twitter.com/jetbrains>`_‏
and `@ThePSF <https://twitter.com/thepsf>`_ with the #pythondevsurvey hashtag.
We’re also very open to any suggestions and feedback related to this survey
which could help us run an even better one next time. Feel free to open issues
`here <https://github.com/python/python-dev-survey/issues>`_ with any comments
or questions.

Many thanks to everyone who participated in the survey and helped us map an
accurate landscape of the Python community!
