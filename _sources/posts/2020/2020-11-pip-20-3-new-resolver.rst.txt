Releasing pip 20.3, featuring new dependency resolver
=====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/11/pip-20-3-new-resolver.html>`_.

On behalf of the `Python Packaging Authority <https://www.pypa.io>`_ and the pip
team, I am pleased to announce that *we have just released pip 20.3* , a new
version of pip. You can install it by running `python -m pip install --upgrade
pip`.

This is an important and disruptive release -- we `explained why in a blog
post last year <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/12/moss-czi-support-
pip.html>`_. We've even made `a video about
it <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4GQCBBsuNU>`_.

Highlights
----------

  * *DISRUPTION* : Switch to the new dependency resolver by default. Watch out for changes in handling editable installs, constraints files, and more: <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#changes-to-the-pip-dependency-resolver-in-20-3-2020>

  * *DEPRECATION* : Deprecate support for Python 3.5 (to be removed in pip 21.0).

  * *DEPRECATION* : pip freeze will stop filtering the pip, setuptools, distribute and wheel packages from pip freeze output in a future version. To keep the previous behavior, users should use the new `--exclude` option.

  * Substantial improvements in new resolver for performance, output and error messages, avoiding infinite loops, and support for constraints files.

  * Support for PEP 600: Future `manylinux` Platform Tags for Portable Linux Built Distributions.

  * Documentation improvements: Resolver migration guide, quickstart guide, and new documentation theme.

  * Add support for MacOS Big Sur compatibility tags.

The new resolver is now _on by default_ for Python 3 users. It is
significantly stricter and more consistent when it receives incompatible
instructions, and reduces support for certain kinds of constraints files, so
some workarounds and workflows may break. Please see `our guide on how to test
and migrate, and how to report
issues <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#changes-to-the-pip-
dependency-resolver-in-20-3-2020>`_. You can use the deprecated (old) resolver,
using the flag `--use-deprecated=legacy-resolver`, until we remove it in the
pip 21.0 release in January 2021.  

You can find more details (including deprecations and removals) `in the
changelog <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/>`_.




Coming soon: end of Python 2.7 support
--------------------------------------

We aim to release pip 21.0 in January 2021, per our `release
cadence <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/release-process/#release-
cadence>`_. At that time, pip will `stop supporting Python
2.7 <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/release-
process/#python-2-support>`_ and will therefore stop supporting Python 2
entirely.



When users use pip 20.3 in a Python 2 environment, the old dependency resolver
is still the default.

This award continues our relationship with Mozilla, which supported Python
packaging tools with `a Mozilla Open Source Support Award in 2017 for
Warehouse <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-awarded-moss-grant-
pypi.html>`_. Thank you, Mozilla! (MOSS has a number of types of awards, which
are open to different sorts of open source/free software projects. If your
project will seek financial support in 2021, do check `the MOSS
website <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/>`_ to see if you qualify.)

  

This is new funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. This project is being
made possible in part by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative DAF, an
advised fund of Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Thank you, CZI! (If your
free software/open source project is seeking funding and is used by
researchers, check `the Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools Rapid Response
Fund <https://investinopen.org/blog/jrost-rapid-response-fund/>`_ and consider
applying.)



The `funding for pip's overhaul <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/12/moss-
czi-support-pip.html>`_ will end at the end of 2020; if your organization wants
to help continue `improvements in Python
packaging <https://github.com/psf/fundable-packaging-improvements/>`_, please
join `the sponsorship
program <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/04/sponsoring-python-
packaging.html>`_.  

  

As with all pip releases, a significant amount of the work was contributed by
pip's user community. Huge thanks to all who have contributed, whether through
code, documentation, issue reports and/or discussion. Your help keeps pip
improving, and is hugely appreciated. Thank you to the pip and
`PyPA <https://www.pypa.io/>`_[](https://www.blogger.com/) maintainers, to the
PSF and the Packaging WG, and to all the contributors and volunteers who work
on or use Python packaging tools.
