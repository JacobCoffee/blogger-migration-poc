It’s time to make nominations for the PSF Board Election!
=========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/its-time-to-make-nominations-for-psf.html>`_.

This year’s Board Election Nomination period opens tomorrow and closes on June
25th. Who runs for the board? People who care about the Python community, who
want to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend
regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and
promote the Python community. Check out our `Life as Python Software
Foundation Director video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M>`_ to
learn more about what being a part of the PSF Board entails. We also invite
you to review our `Annual Impact Report for
2023 <https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/>`_ to learn more about the
PSF mission and what we do.  
  
Current Board members want to share what being on the Board is like and are
making themselves available to answer all your questions about
responsibilities, activities, and time commitments via online chat. Please
join us on the `PSF Discord <https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG>`_ for the `Board
Election Office Hours <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/blog-post.html>`_
(June 11th, 4-5 PM UTC and June 18th, 12-1 PM UTC)  to talk with us about
running for the PSF Board.
