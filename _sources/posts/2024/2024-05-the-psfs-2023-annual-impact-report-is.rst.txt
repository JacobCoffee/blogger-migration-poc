2023 was an exciting year of growth for the Python Software Foundation! We’ve
captured some of the key numbers, details, and information in our `latest
Annual Impact Report <https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/>`_. Some
highlights of what you’ll find in the report include:  

  * A letter from our Executive Director, Deb Nicholson
  * Notes from Our PyCon US Chair, Marietta Wijaya, and PSF Board of Director Chair, Dawn Wages
  * Updates on the achievements and activities of a couple of our Developers-in-Residence, Łukasz Langa and Seth Larson—and announcing more members of the DiR team!
  * An overview of what our PyPI Safety & Security Engineer, Mike Fiedler, has accomplished- as well as some eye-watering PyPI stats!
  * A celebration and summary of PyCon US 2023, the event’s 20th anniversary, and the theme for 2023’s report cover
  * A highlight of our Fiscal Sponsorees (we brought on 7 new organizations this year!)
  * `Sponsors <https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/>`_ who generously supported our work and the Python ecosystem
  * An overview of PSF Financials, including a consolidated financial statement and grants data
