Announcing Our New Infrastructure Engineer
==========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/announcing-our-new-infrastructure.html>`_.

We are excited to announce that `Jacob Coffee <https://github.com/JacobCoffee>`_
has joined the `Python Software Foundation
staff <https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/>`_ as an Infrastructure
Engineer bringing his experience as an Open Source maintainer, dedicated
`homelab <https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab>`_ maintainer, and professional
systems administrator to the team. Jacob will be the second member of our
Infrastructure staff, reporting to Director of Infrastructure, Ee Durbin.

Joining our team, Jacob will share the responsibility of maintaining the PSF
systems and services that serve the Python community, CPython development, and
our internal operations. This will add crucially needed redundancy to the team
as well as capacity to undertake new initiatives with our infrastructure.

Jacob shares, _“I’m living the dream by supporting the PSF mission AND working
in open source! I’m thrilled to be a part of the PSF team and deepen my
contributions to the Python community.”_ _  
_

  
In just the first few days, Jacob has already shown initiative on multiple
projects and issues throughout the infrastructure and we’re excited to see the
impact he’ll have on the PSF and broader Python community. We hope that you’ll
wish him a warm welcome as you see him across the repos, issue trackers,
mailing lists, and discussion forums!
