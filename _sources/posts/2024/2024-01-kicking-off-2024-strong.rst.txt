Kicking off 2024 strong, thanks to our community!
=================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/01/kicking-off-2024-strong.html>`_.

We are starting off the year feeling energized and supported, thanks to each
of you who shared or donated to our year-end fundraiser and membership drive.
We raised a whopping $43,000 through our
`PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ partnership with
`JetBrains <https://www.jetbrains.com/>`_–that’s more than double last year!
With over 150 individual donations, new Supporting Memberships, and JetBrains’
generous partnership, we raised $134,175 total for our work supporting Python
and the Python community! All in all, during the period of the fundraiser, we
raised close to $200K, which includes donations from `our
sponsors <https://www.python.org/psf/sponsors/>`_, donations to `our Fiscal
Sponsorees <https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/>`_, Membership
renewals, and proceeds from the special replay of our Humble Bundle, thanks to
`No Starch Press <https://nostarch.com/>`_.  


Your generous support means we can confidently start 2024 by investing in our
key goals for the year. These goals include:  

  * Improving dialogue with the global community

  * Investing in community support

  * Creating more pathways for technical contributions

We rely on community investment–of money, but also time, energy, ideas, and
enthusiasm–to reach each of these goals.

Supporting Membership is a great way for the community to invest in the PSF’s
work. It was exciting to see many new Supporting Members made use of `our
sliding scale rate option <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/12/introducing-
new-sliding-scale-membership.html>`_ to become Members. Welcome aboard, new
members, and thank you for joining us! We’re looking forward to having your
voice take part in the PSF’s future.  
  
Because the PSF doesn’t buy lists or ads, your help in sharing our fundraiser
with your networks makes a big difference, and we really appreciate how many
of you took the extra time to help promote it. We’re excited about where 2024
will take us together, and as always, we’d love to hear your ideas and
feedback. Looking for how to keep in touch with us? You can find all the ways
in our `"Where is the PSF?" blog
post <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/11/where-is-psf.html>`_.  
  
  
Wishing you all a wonderful & Python-filled new year!  
\- The PSF Team
