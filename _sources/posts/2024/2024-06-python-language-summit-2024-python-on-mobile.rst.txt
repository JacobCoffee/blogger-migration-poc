The Python Language Summit 2024: Python on Mobile
=================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-python-on-mobile.html>`_.

Malcolm Smith from BeeWare presented on the status and direction of Python on
mobile platforms like iOS and Android. BeeWare has been working on bringing
Python to mobile for a few years now. Previously Russell Keith-Magee gave a
talk at the `Language Summit in 2023 on
BeeWare <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-
summit-2023-python.html>`_ to announce plans for `Tier 3
support <https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#tier-3>`_ for Python on Android and
iOS in Python 3.13 along with Anaconda's funded support for the project.  

Now we've arrived at Python 3.13 pre-releases, and things are going well!
Malcolm reported that "the implementations are nearly complete" along with
thank-yous to the core developers who helped with the project.

Overview of current Python mobile platform support  
  
  
The other platforms listed in the table "iOS x86_64 and Android ARM32/x86",
don't have any plans to be implemented. There aren't any actual physical
devices for iOS on x86_64 as the architecture is only used for development
simulators.  

For Android the ARM32 and x86 platforms are being phased out due to being
32-bit architectures and today represent less than 10% of devices. For these
reasons, Malcolm and team have decided not to implement support for this
architecture.  

Malcolm also reported that there is a buildbot for iOS and in the coming weeks
there will be buildbots added for Android ARM64 and x86_64 platforms.

Let's talk packages!  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is well-known for its rich package ecosystem, and the BeeWare team is
working on bringing Python packages to mobile Python, too. "It's not enough
just to have support for CPython", Malcolm said on this topic, "we also need
to support the packaging ecosystem". As with many new platforms for Python,
pure Python packages work without much issue and "the difficulty comes in with
anything which contains native compiled components".

The current and future approach for mobile-friendly Python packages  
  


The BeeWare team's approach so far has been to bootstrap packages with native
components on their own by creating tools and "building wheels for popular
packages like numpy, cryptography, and Pillow". Malcolm reported that the
current approach of rebuilding individual packages isn't scalable and the team
would need to help upstream maintainers build their own mobile wheels. Malcolm
said the team plans to focus this year on "making it as easy as possible to
produce and release [mobile] wheels within existing workflows" and
contributing to tools like cibuildwheel, setuptools, and PyO3.

Malcolm also hopes that "by the end of this year some of the major packages
will be in position to start releasing mobile wheels to the Python Package
Index". The team has already specified a format for the wheel tags for iOS
(`PEP 730 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/#packaging>`_) and Android (`PEP
738 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0738/#packaging>`_). "The binary compatibility
situation is pretty good", Malcolm noted that iOS and Android both come from a
single source in Apple and Google respectively meaning "there's a fairly well-
defined set of libraries available on each version".

Python today provides an embeddable package for the Windows platform. Malcolm
requested from the group that more official Python embeddable packages be
created for each of the mobile platforms with headers and libraries to ease
building Python packages for those platforms. Having these artifacts available
would provide a reference for binary compatibility on those platforms.

Ned Deily, the macOS release expert for CPython, agreed that having more
binary releases for macOS and iOS is something we "should definitely do in the
3.14 timeframe".  

Challenges with keeping mobile buildbots green  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Malcolm provided the core developer team some tips on writing Python code with
these new and constrained platforms in mind. He warned that there is little to
no support for spawning subprocesses, but "multi-threading on the other hand
is perfectly fine on both of these platforms".

Mobile platforms also tend to be constrained in terms of security. iOS only
allows loading libraries from specific folders and Android has restrictions
like not being able to read the root directory or create hard links.

Given these differences, "it's reasonable to expect that mobile platforms will
have more frequent failures as development proceeds, so how do we go about
testing them?" The full CPython test suite is running on both mobile platforms
with buildbots, but today there's no testing done before a pull request is
merged. This situation leads to mobile buildbots starting to fail without the
contributing developer necessarily noticing.

This problem is exacerbated by limited continuous integration (CI) resources
in GitHub Actions, especially for macOS which limits virtualization on ARM64
processors. Malcolm suggested evaluating `GitHub's Merge Queue
feature <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-
merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-
queue#about-merge-queues>`_ as a potential way to solve this issue by requiring
a small amount of testing on mobile platforms without blocking development of
features.

Malcolm's proposal for better visibility of test failures for mobile  
  
  

≈Åukasz Langa agreed that CI was an issue, one that he's actively looking
improving, but wasn't convinced that using a merge queue would decrease the
number of jobs required to run. Malcolm clarified that he is proposing only
running a smaller subset of jobs per-commit in pull requests and the complete
set, including some buildbots, as a part of pre-merge testing.  

Many folks expressed concern about adding buildbots as a part of pre-merge or
per-commit checks, because buildbots have no high-availability SLA and often
suffer occasional outages, some buildbots not being reliable and therefore
preventing merging of commits, and concerns about security of unreviewed
changes running on buildbots.  

Thomas Wouters, Python 3.13 release manager, was "unconvinced" on adding pre-
merge testing for Tier 3 platforms, something that is `usually reserved for
Tier 1 platforms <https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#support-tiers>`_.

Ned Deily recommended doing iOS builds as a part of existing macOS builds in
GitHub Actions. This would catch build errors for the platform and would
likely find some issues early without much additional investment.
