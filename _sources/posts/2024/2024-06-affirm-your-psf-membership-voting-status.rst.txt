Affirm your PSF Membership Voting Status
========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/affirm-your-psf-membership-voting-status.html>`_.

Every PSF voting-eligible Member (Supporting, Managing, Contributing, and
Fellow) needs to affirm their membership to vote in this year’s election.  
  
*If you wish to vote in this year’s election, you must affirm your intention
to vote no later than Tuesday, June 25th, 2:00 pm UTC to participate in this
year’s election.* This year’s Board Election vote begins Tuesday, July 2nd,
2:00 pm UTC and closes on Tuesday, July 16th, 2:00 pm UTC. You should have
received an email from "psf@psfmember.org <Python Software Foundation>" with
subject "[Action Required] Affirm your PSF Membership voting status" that
contains information on how to affirm your voting status. If you were
expecting to receive the email but have not (make sure to check your spam!),
please email `psf-elections@pyfound.org <mailto:psf-elections@pyfound.org>`_ and
we’ll assist you.  

PSF Bylaws
----------

Section 4.2 of the `PSF Bylaws <https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/>`_ requires
that “Members of any membership class with voting rights must affirm each year
to the corporation in writing that such member intends to be a voting member
for such year.”

The PSF did not enforce this before 2023 because it was technically
challenging. Now that we can track our entire voting membership on
psfmember.org, we are implementing this requirement.

Our motivation is to ensure that our elections can meet quorum as required by
Section 3.9 of `our bylaws <https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/>`_. As our
membership has grown, we have seen that an increasing number of Contributing,
Managing, and Fellow members with indefinite membership do not engage with our
annual election, making quorum difficult to reach.

An election that does not reach quorum is invalid. This would cause the whole
voting process to be re-held as well as create an undue amount of effort on
the part of the PSF Staff.  

Need to check your membership status?
-------------------------------------

You can see your membership record and status on your `PSF Member User
Information page <https://psfmember.org/user-information>`_ (note you must be
logged in to psfmember.org to view that page). If you are a voting-eligible
member (active Supporting, Managing, Contributing, and Fellow members of the
PSF) and do not already have a login, please `create an account on
psfmember.org <https://psfmember.org/wp-login.php?action=register>`_ first and
then email psf-donations@python.org so we can link your membership to your
account. Please ensure you have an account linked to your membership so that
we can have the most up-to-date contact information for you in the future.  

What happens next?
------------------

You’ll get an email from OpaVote with a ballot on or before July 2nd and then
you can vote!

Check out our `PSF Membership page <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_ to
learn more. If you have questions about membership or nominations please email
psf-donations@python.org. Join the `PSF
Discord <https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG>`_ for the `Board Office
