Matching Donations to PyPy in September!
========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/09/matching-donations-to-pypy-in-september.html>`_.

We're thrilled to announce that we will be matching donations made to the
`PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_ project for the month of September. For every dollar
donated this month, the PSF will also give a dollar, up to a $10,000 total
contribution. Head to `*http://pypy.org/* <http://pypy.org/>`_ and view the
donation options on the right side of the page, including general funding or a
donation targeted to their STM, Py3k, or NumPy efforts.  
  
We've previously given a $10,000 donation to PyPy, and more recently seeded
the STM efforts with $5,000. The PyPy project works with the `Software Freedom
Conservancy <https://sfconservancy.org/>`_ to manage fund raising efforts and
the usage of the funds, and they'll be the ones notifying us of how you all
made your donations. At the end of the month, we'll do our part and chip  in
to making PyPy even better.  
  
The matching period runs today through the end of September.
