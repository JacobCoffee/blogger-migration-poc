A new conference: Python Namibia!
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-new-conference-python-namibia.html>`_.

The Python community has been fortunate to experience a lot of growth over the
last few years, especially when it comes to user groups and conferences. A lot
of these meetings have seen huge attendance, with
`PyCon <https://us.pycon.org/2015/>`_ having sold out the last three years,
regional conferences seeing sharp growth, and some monthly meetups
occasionally "selling out" (they're free, but attract more than the venue can
hold). On top of those existing events growing, we're seeing more events pop
up around the world.  
  
We just got word that another new conference is starting up: `Python
 <http://python-namibia.org/>`_`Namibia <http://python-namibia.org/>`_, taking
place February 2-5. This first time conference is taking place in Windhoek at
the University of Namibia, with collaboration from Cardiff University, giving
a group of students an opportunity to attend as part of their studies!  
  
"Open-source software represents an opportunity for developing nations to
become owners and producers of the software that they need; it's a key to
their future prosperity," said organizer Daniele Procida. "There's an enormous
benefit to software developers in being part of a supportive community."  
  
The conference plans to start with two days of talks, a day of workshops and
tutorials, and concluding with collaborative activities like sprints, as well
as planning work for hosting a PyCon Namibia in 2016.  
  
"We hope that this event will help programmers in Namibia feel that they
belong to a welcoming international community that values their participation
- and that it will help set a series of virtuous circles into motion," says
Daniele.
