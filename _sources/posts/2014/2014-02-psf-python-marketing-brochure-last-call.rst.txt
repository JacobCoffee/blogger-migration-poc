PSF Python Marketing Brochure - Last call for Ad Sponsors
=========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/02/psf-python-marketing-brochure-last-call.html>`_.

_Please support the PSF in providing the Python community with  
free high quality marketing material to  
promote Python_

  

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over the last few years, the Python brochure team has worked on and created a
high-quality brochure to help user groups, conferences and companies using
Python to promote and spread the word about Python.

The brochure will be printed in a first edition of 10,000 copies which the PSF
will then distribute to user groups, Python conferences and educational
institutions on request and free of charge.

With the Python brochure, we hope to reach out to an audience which is not
easy to address and convince using electronic and mostly developer oriented
media.

Seeking your help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

The team set out to create and print the brochure without introducing extra
costs for the PSF. Our aim is to fully finance the brochure production,
printing and shipment to interested parties using money from sponsors.

To make this happen, we are seeking your help !

  * We have already signed up sponsors for 6 half page ads, but still need another *5 half page ad sponsors* to sign up.  
  

  * There are also *6 smaller reference entry sponsorships* left to be sold.

If you are affiliated with or know a company investing into Python and looking
for ways to reach out to a large audience of interested Python users,
students, developers - and people in key decision making positions, please
reach out to us and help make the project a success.

The deadline for ad and reference entry signups is *Feb 28 2014* \- in just
under three weeks.

You can find all the details about the available sponsorship options on this
page:

  * *`Brochure Sponsoring Options <http://brochure.getpython.info/sponsorship>`_*

Orders can be placed directly with the production company, Evenios Publishing
on the website. All sponsors will receive a box of about 120 free copies of
the brochure as Thank You gift.

  

Ordering extra copies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

Companies who are interested in receiving extra copies can pre-order
additional boxes which will then be printed in addition to the initial 10.000
copy batch:
