Sponsoring the Kivy App Contest
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/03/sponsoring-kivy-app-contest.html>`_.

The `Python Software Foundation <https://www.python.org/psf/>`_ is thrilled to
support `Kivy <http://kivy.org/#home>`_ on their upcoming `developer
contest <http://kivy.org/#contest>`_, the second of its kind. The contest begins
by accepting entries, either for teams or individuals, on April 2. However,
the topic of the contest won't be known at that time. On April 15, the Kivy
Project releases the topic and the teams have one month to develop their
applications, wrapping up on May 14.  
  
The organizers aim to "encourage and give developers an opportunity to learn
more about Python and Kivy," through the contest. As Kivy is a cross-platform
toolkit, they hope to see applications running not only on desktop operating
systems, but also on mobile. The theme they plan won't be too limiting, so all
platforms can join in the fun.  
  
Visual styling will be among the judging criteria, so they're hoping to see
some good looking entries. "Without giving anything away, the ideas could
range from a simple scientific calculator, to an alarm clock manager, a diary
app, or a maths tutor," the organizers said.  
  
"The PSF has been a big part of helping us grow by providing us sponsorship,"
they said of the $2000 USD granted to support the contest. Jessica McKellar,
they said, was "a big part of helping us get this competition off the ground."  
  
"The project has been getting quite popular lately, especially with the
increasing interest in mobile applications," they said of Kivy. Part of the
attraction comes from being able to work with pure Python across all of the
platforms, allowing developers to leverage the huge amount of code the Python
community has made available.  
  
When it comes to Kivy's development, they're preparing a lot of new features
for the next major release, especially support for SDL2 backends. Adding SDL
support should make for a much more speedy experience on mobile platforms, and
give them more flexibility overall. They're also putting some focus on some
projects that surround Kivy, such as `Plyer <http://github.com/kivy/plyer>`_ and
`Buildozer <http://github.com/kivy/buildozer>`_.  
  
If you're new to Python or Kivy, the organizers have created a level playing
field that will allow both experienced and new programmers to partake. "Our
judgement criteria will include not just areas of technical merit, but also a
focus on great app ideas, user engagement, and use of Kivy features," they
said.  
  
"So come on dive in and make your first mobile app using Python facilitated by
the Kivy framework!"
