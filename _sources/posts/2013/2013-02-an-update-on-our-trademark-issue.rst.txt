An Update on Our Trademark Issue
================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/02/an-update-on-our-trademark-issue.html>`_.

*A few days ago,`we reached out <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/02/python-
trademark-at-risk-in-europe-we.html>`_ for help to gather evidence about the use
of “Python” in Europe. We received an overwhelming response from the
community, with hundreds of letters from individuals, companies, and
universities, as well as scans of articles, book covers, conference T-shirts,
and brochures. It has been truly been amazing to see.  
  
Unfortunately, we also saw that there were a few who decided to directly
attack the people and the company we are opposing. We put out a `call for
civility <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/02/asking-for-civility-during-
our.html>`_ \- and we want to emphasize that any hacktivism or threats will end
up hurting the Python community in the long run. This is not who we are or how
we act.  
  
Although the issues have not yet been resolved, we are engaged in good-faith
negotiations with the head of Veber, and we hope and expect that we will be
able to announce a settlement soon.*
