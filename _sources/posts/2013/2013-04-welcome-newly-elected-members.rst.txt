Welcome Newly Elected Members
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/04/welcome-newly-elected-members.html>`_.

The Foundation recently held elections after PyCon 2013, and the results are
in!  
  
All members of the PSF are nominated by an existing member for their work in
the Python community. We have quite a diverse set of community members joining
us this year, with representation across many countries and individuals
contributing to many areas of the Python world.  

  

As with years past, a group of individuals known for their contributions of
code, either to Python implementations or other projects in the Python
ecosystem, were elected. We also have a number of members recognized for their
work with PyCon and other Python conferences around the world. Community
effort is another theme and we have several members known for their work
building and expanding their local Python communities as well as the global
community.

  

Please join us in welcoming all of the new members to the Foundation!

were elected to join the board under Van Lindberg's chairmanship. The new
board members are:
