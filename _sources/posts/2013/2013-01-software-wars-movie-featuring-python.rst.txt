"Software Wars" the movie - featuring Python!
=============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/01/software-wars-movie-featuring-python.html>`_.

As the `Software Wars <http://www.indiegogo.com/SoftwareWars>`_ indiegogo
campaign comes to a close in the last 40 hours, did you know Python plays a
role in the movie? Creator Keith Curtis wrote to us to mention that William
Stein, creator of `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_, is interviewed and
endorses Python's use for teaching mathematics to children. There are also
plans to interview others in the community, perhaps some of the children
making use of Python.  
  
The creators greatly appreciate your contributions to make `Software
Wars <http://www.indiegogo.com/SoftwareWars>`_ possible!
