Get ready for Google Summer of Code
===================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/03/get-ready-for-google-summer-of-code.html>`_.

Python project contributors and student enthusiasts, mark your calendars:
Google Summer of Code applications open soon!  
  
`Google Summer of Code <https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/>`_ is an
annual, global program pairing student developers with mentors in open source
projects for paid summer internships.  
  
You can learn more about this year's Google Summer of Code
`here <https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013>`_.  

Python projects
===============

Python serves as an umbrella organization for around a dozen open source
Python projects each year. Last year Python core, mailman, Pandas, PyGame,
Pylons, PySide, PySoy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Tryton, and Twisted
participated.  
  
If your Python project is interested in participating in Google Summer of Code
under the Python umbrella, it's time to start preparing your applications:  

  1. Tell the Python Google Summer of Code coordinators that your project wants to participate! Follow the `instructions on the Python wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2013>`_.
  2. Review `last year's projects and their idea pages <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2012>`_.
  3. Start outlining candidate student projects. Good student projects are detailed, can be broken down into step-by-step goals, and are realistic in scope and difficulty for a 3-month student intern.
  4. Start gathering mentors. We recommend that each student have both a primary and backup mentor.

Important deadlines
-------------------

  * *March 18* : Mentoring organizations can begin submitting applications to Google.
  * *March 29* : Mentoring organization application deadline.

Students
========

Google Summer of Code is a paid summer internship program for
college/university students who will be 18 years of age or older on May 27,
2013. Participating in Google Summer of Code is a great way to develop real-
world software engineering skills while giving back to an open source Python
project you love.  
  
Read more about eligibility in the `FAQ <https://www.google-
melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page>`_.  
  
If you are interested in participating in Google Summer of Code under the
Python umbrella, it's time to start exploring potential projects and
practicing the tools of open source development:  

  1. Read the `Python Google Summer of Code guidelines <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2013>`_.
  2. `Review last year's projects and their idea pages <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2012>`_.
  3. Start practicing the tools of open source development, including:  

     * IRC
     * a revision control system like git or svn
     * the diff and patch utilities
     * bug trackers

If you've never used some of these tools before, don't worry! You have plenty
of time to practice. A good resource for getting familiar with these tools is
the `OpenHatch training missions <http://openhatch.org/missions/>`_.  
  

Important deadlines
-------------------

  * *April 8* : List of accepted mentoring organizations published on theGoogle Summer of Code 2013 site.
  * *April 9 - 21* : Student applicants discuss application ideas with mentoring organizations.
  * *April 22* : Student application period opens.
  * *May 3* : Student application deadline.

Note that the best way to boost your chances of being accepted for Google
Summer of Code is to start contributing to a project *before* you apply. If
you have questions about how to get started or just want some friendly
encouragement, visit the OpenHatch project and `say
hello <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact>`_.
