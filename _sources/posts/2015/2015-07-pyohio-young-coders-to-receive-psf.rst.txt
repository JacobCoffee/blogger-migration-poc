PyOhio Young Coders to receive PSF Funding
==========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/07/pyohio-young-coders-to-receive-psf.html>`_.

The PSF is always thrilled to be able to help introduce young people to the
world of programming. As such, `Young Coders'
Workshops <https://us.pycon.org/2015/events/letslearnpython/>`_ (also see
`O'Reilly <http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/08/so-you-want-to-run-a-young-coders-
class.html>`_) are especially close to our hearts. Young Coders, for those of
you who don’t know, was started in 2013 at PyCon in Santa Clara by Katie
Cunningham and Barbara Shaurette (see `My Dinner with
Katie <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/my-dinner-with-katie.html>`_). Kids
ages 12-17 learn to code using Raspberry Pis, which they then get to keep.

Recently, the PSF has granted funding for PyOhio and for its Young Coders'
Workshop. The conference will be held August 1st - 2nd on the campus of Ohio
State University in Columbus, Oh, while the YC workshop will take place on Sat
August 1 (see `PyOhio <http://www.pyohio.org/schedule/>`_).

PyOhio serves as a regional conference for the Midwest with many attendees
from surrounding states. Attendance at PyOhio has grown from 150 in 2010 to
400 in 2014. There will be 4 tracks of talks over 2 days and three days of
sprints. This year’s schedule include a keynote by Catherine Devlin and talks
by Brandon Rhodes and Brian Curtin among others. Registration is free (see
`PyOhio <http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pyohio-2015-registration-16366701244>`_)!

Brian Costlow, Chair of PyOhio, explains that the Young Coders Workshop
targets kids who wouldn’t otherwise get the opportunity. PyOhio organizers
reach out to partners to get the word out to those beyond tech circles. They
reserve 40% of workshop slots for their partner organizations' for kids from
disadvantaged neighborhoods. Last year in 2014, the kids came from one of the
most economically distressed neighborhoods in Columbus (see `Demographic
Info <https://www.lowerlights.org/about-llm/the-community-we-serve>`_).

This year, the `_Boys & Girls Clubs of Columbus,
OH_ <http://www.bgccolumbus.org/>`_ is helping to recruit kids from poorer
neighborhoods.

According to Brian,

> We’ll pull kids from more than one neighborhood this year, but the highest
> median household income is $32,000 and all of the neighborhoods have at
> least 15% of households below the poverty line. By way of contrast, the
> median income for the Greater Columbus Statistical Metropolitan area is
> $44,000, but if you exclude the distressed neighborhoods, the household
> median income is around $80,000 and only 2% are below the poverty line.

The PSF is happy to be able to help with funding for such a worthwhile event.
Not only do the kids get to keep the Raspberry Pis, but they also go home with
the keyboard, mouse, and cable. This is especially important for
underprivileged kids who may not have access to computers outside of school.

Other sponsors of PyOhio and Young Coders include `Level
12 <https://www.level12.io/>`_, `Safari <https://www.safaribooksonline.com/>`_,
and `Caktus Group <http://www.caktusgroup.com/>`_, to name a few (see
`Sponsors <http://www.pyohio.org/sponsors/>`_). But sponsors are still needed,
so there is still an opportunity to help! Please visit `Sponsor
