PSF Python Brochure: Get your free copy at PyCon 2015
=====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/psf-python-brochure-get-your-free-copy.html>`_.

`![PSF Python Brochure Vol.
1 <http://brochure.getpython.info/media/images/newsletter-5-banner>`_](http://brochure.getpython.info/)  

*`PSF Python Brochure PDF (low resolution
version) <http://brochure.getpython.info/media/releases/psf-python-brochure-
vol.-i-final-download.pdf>`_*

  
After having distributed the first 5,000 copies of the `PSF Python
Brochure <http://brochure.getpython.info/>`_ to Python conferences and user
groups around the world in the last 12 months, we have *now finished the
second print run with another 5,000 copies* just in time for PyCon 2015 in
Montreal.  
  
Many thanks go to JetBrains for jumping in as additional ad sponsor to help
finance the printing and community order shipping costs for this second print
run. We would also like to thank all our initial sponsors and contributors for
their hard work.  
  

Promoting Python to new audiences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
The feedback we have received for the brochure was positive all around.  
  
Conference attendees were really happy to be able to easily show and prove how
Python changes the world, to make the point that *learning and using Python
is a good investment*.  
  
The brochure helps them in promoting Python in their local and professional
communities, especially to the many *non-technical people* we cannot easily
reach with our `python.org web site <https://www.python.org/>`_.  
  

Get your brochure copy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
Come and *get your copy at the Python Software Foundation booth*(booth
number 101) at PyCon 2015 in Montreal.  
  
If you cannot fetch your hard copy in person, you can order copies from our
project page:  

  1. free `*Community Orders* <https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata>`_ for conferences and user groups
  2. paid `*Company Orders* <https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata>`_ for companies and organizations

The costs for the community orders are sponsored through sponsor ads, the
`PSF <https://www.python.org/psf/>`_ and the company orders.  
  

Meet the Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
I was very happy to work together with our core team members in the last 4
years`:`  

  * Jan Ulrich Hasecke who was responsible as editor in chief and managed the contribution side of things together with me.
  * Armin Stro√ü-Radschinski and his company evenios which did the initial coordination of funding, layout concept, artwork, production and distribution.

  
Our efforts have resulted in a brochure of almost fully CC-3.0-BY-SA content
that is reusable by the community. The feedback after one year of circulation
is quite promising and we are considering doing a second volume with more
success stories and use cases, provided we can get enough support from
sponsors and the PSF.
