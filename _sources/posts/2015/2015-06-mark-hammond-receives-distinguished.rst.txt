Mark Hammond Receives Distinguished Service Award
=================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/06/mark-hammond-receives-distinguished.html>`_.

Like other community-based open source software, volunteers from around the
world are to thank for Python's existence. When it comes to Python on Windows,
the crew overseeing it are much smaller in number than those involved in other
platforms, and one person in particular stands out among them with
contributions that have helped shape Python's existence on Windows: Mark
Hammond. Mark's efforts in supporting the Microsoft platform have been so
influential that the CPython Windows installer contained a message thanking
him in several versions in the 2.x series of releases. It is my pleasure to
announce that Mark has been chosen to receive our `Distinguished Service
Award <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-distinguished-awards/#id1>`_
for his contributions to our community.

Not only have Mark's efforts been seen within CPython itself, from the winreg
and os modules to the `PEP 397 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/>`_
"Python launcher for Windows" and other areas, but also outside of it through
his creation and maintenance of the
`pywin32 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_ package. That project has
made so many things possible for developers building software on Windows. If
it weren't for pywin32 and its ability to manipulate Excel spreadsheets, one
of my first jobs would have went a very different way than it did. The ability
to easily take care of those tasks meant I was able to move on and explore
different things both within the products I was working on as well as Python
itself, and it's because of this productivity that I was able to shift my
focus and ultimately take on what turned out to be a better career path for
me. I've talked to several others who have shared this same experience, and
have seen it around the web for years.

Mark also authored "Python Programming on Win32" in 2000, a book I stole from
my dad and still have to this day, despite it being warped and actually
slightly moldy from being in a flooded basement. The book states "Python is
growing in popularity; based on download statistics, there are now over
450,000 people using Python, and more than 150,000 people using Python on
Windows." It's hard to know exactly how those numbers were discovered, but I
was able to pull off of the old website infrastructure that in 2013, Windows
installers for Python were downloaded nearly 35 million times. Although you
can't really compare the two numbers, we know that Python has experienced a
huge amount of growth over the last 15 years, and it's thanks in part to
contributors like Mark.  
  
On behalf of the Python Software Foundation: thank you Mark!
