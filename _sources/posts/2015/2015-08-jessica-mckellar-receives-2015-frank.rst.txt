Jessica McKellar receives 2015 Frank Willison Award
===================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/08/jessica-mckellar-receives-2015-frank.html>`_.

Ask any Pythonista to name the best features of Python and they are sure to
include its amazing community. For the past 15 years the PSF has recognized
this important feature with its Community Service Awards and with a special
annual award for outstanding contributions to the Python Community–the `Frank
Willison Award <https://www.python.org/community/awards/frank-willison/>`_.

I am extremely happy to report that this year’s Frank Willison Award was
presented at OSCON 2015 to Jessica McKellar (see `Award
Ceremony <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ePrF3G9Ss4>`_).

The award is a memorial to the legacy of O'Reilly editor-in-chief, Frank
Willison, who died in 2001. Author of the column "Frankly Speaking," Willison
shared his enthusiasm for programming, open-source, and, in particular, Python
with his many appreciative readers. His writings and witticisms can be found
at `O'Reilly Archives <http://archive.oreilly.com/oreilly/frank/>`_ and `In
Memory <http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly//news/frank_0701.html>`_.
