BBC’s micro:bit project open-sourced today!
===========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/10/bbcs-microbit-project-open-sourced-today.html>`_.

As you may recall, there have been a couple of previous posts to this blog
about the `BBC’s micro:bit
project <http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/microbit>`_  (also see `PSF
newsblog <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/07/bbc-microbit-successfully-
launched.html>`_).

The micro:bit is a small, stripped-down, wearable computer (similar to a
_Raspberry Pi_) and based on an nRF51 chip. The educational project, part of a
larger UK program called "_Make it Digital,_"  is designed to inspire children
to become digital creators by giving away 1 million micro:bits to all 11 year-
old UK schoolchildren this spring.

Today I heard some exciting news about the project from our good friend,
Nicholas Tollervey, which I’m happy to pass along here.

According to Nicholas:

> From the beginning the BBC have said that Python would be one of the
> possible languages that the device can be programmed in. The PSF is one of
> around twenty organisations in the project partnership. Since it’s a
> microcontroller, and the aim is to run Python… well, there’s a pretty
> obvious answer when trying to combine those two things.

> We’re incredibly pleased to announce that MicroPython runs on the BBC’s
> micro:bit. Furthermore, all the work done so far is being open-sourced today
> and the repository can be found here:
> <https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython>

> [](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython)Right now only the code
> related to the MicroPython port is released. When the device is delivered,
> all the resources needed to recreate the entire project are to be released
> under an open license. The laudable intention is to provide an unencumbered
> legacy so others can build upon and adapt the work of the partnership that
> has created this device.

> To read more details and learn the story of how MicroPython came to be on
> the micro:bit, check out Nicholas Tollervey’s blog post found here:
> <http://ntoll.org/article/story-micropython-on-microbit>

> Finally, there is much to be done. The project needs help from people with
> skill and experience developing for such devices. Could you contribute
> something to a project that will touch the lives of 1 million children and
> leave an open legacy that anyone could re-use? If so then please read the
> above-linked post and head on over to the code repository.

I hope that many of you will take Nicholas up on his request to contribute to
this worthwhile project.
