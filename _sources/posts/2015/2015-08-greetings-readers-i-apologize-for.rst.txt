CSA Awards to Tollervey, Stinner, and Storchaka
===============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/08/greetings-readers-i-apologize-for.html>`_.

Greetings Readers,

I apologize for the hiatus I’ve taken recently from writing this blog -- other
commitments temporarily got in the way. But during this time the PSF has been
hard at work, and I intend to catch you up on their activities in the next few
posts.

First of all, the Community Service Awards have been given out for both the
second and third quarters of 2015. I am extremely happy to announce that the
second quarter award went to our good friend, Nicholas Tollervey, for his
excellent work in education and outreach. You can read more about Nick in a
recent previous post to this blog
(`Tollervey <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/06/nicholas-tollervey-and-
python-in.html>`_), so I’ll forgo saying more about him here, other than
"congratulations,"  and will turn to telling you about our third quarter award
recipients.

> RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the 2015 3rd Quarter
> Community Service Award to Victor Stinner and Serhiy Storchaka (`PSF
> CSA <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/>`_).

Both Stinner and Storchaka are extremely active Python core developers. In the
past three years, Serhiy has contributed well over 2000 commits, while Victor
comes in a close second with almost 2000. Their hard work and dedication have
helped increase Python’s vitality, relevance, and amazing growth -- a fact
that the PSF wishes to recognize with this award.

In addition, Serhiy Storchaka is active on the Python tracker, taking the time
to help other contributors by reviewing and committing their patches.

Victor Stinner’s work additionally includes 20 PEPs (see
`PEPs <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/>`_) as well as active participation in
the Python community. You can view his PyCon 2014 talk
`here <http://www.pyvideo.org/speaker/180/victor-stinner>`_. He is also one of
the developers of the
`tulip/asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ project which
provides asynchronous I/O support to Python. It was Victor who ported
tulip/asyncio to Python 2; its usefulness has resulted in its recently being
included as part of the Python 3.4 standard library.

them for their important work.
