First-Ever PyCaribbean Coming This February!
============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/11/first-ever-pycaribbean-coming-this.html>`_.

At the October 28th meeting of the Board of Directors of the PSF, the
following resolution was passed:

> "RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation sponsor PyCaribbean on
> February 20-21, 2016 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in the amount of
> $3000 USD."

This will be the first-ever PyCaribbean, and the PSF is proud to be a
Platinum-level sponsor. The venue will be the headquarters of the Fundación
Global Democracia y Desarrollo (FUNGLODE) located at Calle Capitán Eugenio de
Marchena 26, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

According to organizer, Leonardo Jiminez, they are expecting approximately 300
- 350 people from all over the Americas and the Caribbean. This is a great
size for a conference, allowing for both intimacy and breadth of content. As
Leornardo puts it:

> "I think we have the spirit you can find in PyCon but in a more concentrated
> way and with better weather."

Based on proposals received so far, it appears that the talks will be quite
diverse. Along with such expected topics as "strategies for improving data
analysis," Leonardo particularly mentioned a talk "about the adventures of
someone teaching Python in Latin America in his car."

Of course, that adventurer is none other than Manuel Kaufmann! Some of you may
recall that last year the PSF funded his project, and it was featured in a
couple of posts to this blog: `Python in
Argentina <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/manuel-kaufmann-and-python-in-
argentina.html>`_ and `Highly
Contagious <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/highly-contagious-python-
spreads.html>`_. And in addition to what is sure to be a fascinating talk by
Manuel Kaufmann, there will also be a keynote by the PSF’s very own Brandon
Rhodes, who is also the organizer of the upcoming PyCon 2016 in Portland.

I asked Leonardo to tell us a little about his local Python community. Here’s
what he said:

And when I asked about his own interest in Python, he gave a great answer:

I have to agree that the community is our "killer feature," so I’m hoping that
some of you will be able to participate in PyCaribbean by giving a talk or by
attending. You have until November 20th to` submit a
proposal <http://proposals@pycaribbean.com/>`_, so please give it some thought.
Of course, if you don’t have a talk prepared, the organizers would still love
to see you there. And could there be any better vacation than to visit the
Dominican Republic in February? In fact, this conference looks so good to me
that I may see you there myself!

For further information, you can contact the organizers (at
`leonardo@pycaribbean.com <mailto:leonardo@pycaribbean.com>`_ or
`vivian@pycaribbean.com <mailto:vivian@pycaribbean.com>`_). Also you can follow
them on Twitter (at <https://twitter.com/pycaribbean>).
