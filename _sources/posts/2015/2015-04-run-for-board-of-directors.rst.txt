Run for the Board of Directors!
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/run-for-board-of-directors.html>`_.

_The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers._

It’s that time of year again! The PSF annual election for its 2015 Board of
Directors is currently seeking candidates.

But what exactly, you may ask, does the PSF Board do? Well, it turns out that
the fulfillment of the above-quoted mission statement requires that they do
quite a bit.

Basically, the directors manage all the business of the PSF. This includes
appointing the PSF’s officers; holding and protecting Python’s intellectual
property rights and licenses (the open source "stack" of licenses on the
source code, all logos and trademarks); managing the budget and allocating
funds; organizing and managing the annual PyCon North America (through the
esteemed PyCon team); maintaining the PSF's legal status as a non-profit
corporation (with all appropriate legal documents, such as articles of
incorporation, bylaws, etc.); managing and maintaining the
_`python.org <http://python.org/>`__  website and related resources; fundraising
and obtaining sponsors; public relations; education and outreach; and
membership management and services (and probably some other categories that I
forgot).

There are 11 total seats available; Directors are elected annually for a term
of one year. Directors need not be residents of the US, and they are not
compensated for their work. See `PSF
ByLaws <https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/>`_ for more complete info.

If you or someone you know would like to run, i.e., do all of that extremely
important work for free—although you will bask in glamor (glamour, if you’re
British), glory, and gratitude, here’s the wiki for nominations: `PSF Director
Nominations <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2015>`_.

At the moment, no deadlines have been set; I will provide that info as soon as
it’s available.

Additional relevant info can be found at: `PSF home
page <http://www.python.org/psf/>`_, `PSF membership
FAQ <http://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_, and `PSF members'
