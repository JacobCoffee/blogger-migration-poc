Sponsor Election Results!
=========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/06/sponsor-election-results.html>`_.

Last month, in addition to the election for the Board of Directors, a separate
election was held asking PSF members to approve three new sponsors. Here is
Ian Cordasco’s announcement of those results:

> … we had 198 voters out of 426 which is ~46.48% of the voting membership (at
> the time). The results are
> `here <https://vote.python.org/init/default/results/15>`_.
>
> In short, *Intel* and *New Relic* both were overwhelmingly approved.
> *Pickaweb* less so but they still received (of the ballots cast) 56%
> approval (111/198).

So, according to the bylaws (Section 4.6), all three sponsors were approved!
Thanks to Ian and everyone who participated. And to the new sponsors,
congratulations and welcome aboard!
