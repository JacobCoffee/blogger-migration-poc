World Domination: One Student at a Time!
========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/world-domination-one-student-at-time.html>`_.

A couple of years ago, I discovered the edX MIT course 6.00x `Intro to
Computer Science and Programming Using
Python <https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-
mitx-6-00-1x-0#.VRSv3JPF8kU>`_. At the time, I was eager to learn Python and CS
basics, so I took the plunge.

The course has been offered through edX each semester since, and at some point
it was divided into two courses to allow more time for in-depth study, as the
original one-semester course moved very quickly from basics to more advanced
topics, such as _complexity classes, plotting techniques, stochastic programs,
probability, random walks, and graph optimization._  I can’t say enough good
things about the excellence of Professor John Guttag, who developed the course
and wrote the accompanying textbook (which is recommended but not required),
along with co-teachers, Profs. Eric Grimson and Chris Terman.

I was grateful at the time to have found a free introductory college-level
course in computer science that uses Python, rather than C, Java, or another
language, as I had already had some acquaintance with Python and wanted to
solidify my foundation and gain more skill. Working through the course led me
to appreciate the features of Python that make it a wonderful teaching
language. Since it is relatively easy to learn, it allows the learner to get
up and running quickly, to write code and get results early on, without
getting too bogged down and discouraged (something that I, as a humanities
rather than a math person, had experienced in the past.) In addition, Python
teaches good programming habits, including the importance of good
documentation, what Prof. Guttag frequently referred to as "good hygiene." I
remember wondering at the time why Python wasn’t always the language taught to
beginners.

Well, today this is the trend.

According to a July 2014 study by Phillip Guo, "Python is Now the `Most
Popular Introductory Teaching Language <http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-
cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-
top-us-universities/fulltext>`_ at Top U.S. Universities." Guo analyzed the
course curricula for the top 39 CS Departments in the US. He used U.S. News'
ranking of best computer science schools in 2014, which begins with Carnegie
Mellon, MIT, Stanford, and UC Berkeley (he stopped at 39 because apparently
there was an 8-way tie for #40), and found that 27 of them teach Python in
their Intro courses. Of the top 10 departments, the proportion was higher– 8
of them teach Python. The next most-taught languages the study found were (in
descending order): Java, MATLAB, C, C+, Scheme, and Scratch. Moreover, in
addition to edX, both Udacity and Coursera use Python for their introductory
courses.

Anecdotally, Guo found that professors in academic fields outside of CS are
increasingly using Python to fill their students' needs for programming
skills. See February’s PSF blog post `Python in
Nature <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-esteemed-international-
scientific.html>`_ for an explanation and example of this trend by Dr. Adina
Howe, Professor of Agriculture and Biosystems Engineering at Iowa State
University.

The increasing popularity of Python as the language for introductory CS
courses in the US will undoubtedly lead to further growth of the Python
community and the language. As Guo explains:

> … the choice of what language to teach first reflects the pedagogical
> philosophy of each department and influences many students' first
> impressions of computer science. The languages chosen by top U.S.
> departments could indicate broader trends in computer science education,
> since those are often trendsetters for the rest of the educational
> community.
