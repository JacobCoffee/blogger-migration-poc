PSF Python Brochure "sold out" - help us kick start the second print run !
==========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/psf-python-brochure-sold-out-help-us.html>`_.

  
  
  
`![PSF Python Brochure Vol.
1 <http://brochure.getpython.info/media/images/newsletter-5-banner>`_](http://brochure.getpython.info/)  
  
  
  

*`PSF Python Brochure PDF (low resolution
version) <http://brochure.getpython.info/media/releases/psf-python-brochure-
vol.-i-final-download.pdf>`_*

  
We are happy to announce that *we have successfully distributed the first
5,000 copies* of the `PSF Python Brochure <http://brochure.getpython.info/>`_
to Python conferences and user groups around the world.  
  
Even without doing any major announcement of the possibility to order the
brochure for conferences and user groups, we easily received enough requests
to have the first print run completely distributed in just a few months.  
  
Brochures were sent to `PyCon US 2014 <https://us.pycon.org/2014/>`_ in
Montreal, `EuroPython 2014 <https://ep2014.europython.eu/>`_, PyCons and open
source conferences in India, UK, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, France,
Belgium and to many professional users around the world.  
  

Promoting Python to new audiences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
The feedback we received was positive all around.  
  
Conference attendees were really happy to be able to easily show and prove how
Python changes the world, to make the point that *learning and using Python
is a good investment*.  
  
The brochure helps them in promoting Python in their local and professional
communities, especially to the many *non-technical people* we cannot easily
reach with our `python.org web site <https://www.python.org/>`_.  
  
We would like to thank all our sponsors and contributors for their hard work
to achieve this impressing result.  
  

Please help us kick start the second print run !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
In order to continue with the distribution of the remaining 5,000 copies of
the Vol. 1 edition, we are now *looking for two additional half __ page ad
sponsors* to help finance the print run and distribution costs.  
  
We have reserved the notes area on the inner back cover page of the brochure
for these extra ads.  
  

If you would like to *show your support for Python* and its community and
*reach out to thousands of people interested in Python* , now is the time to
`sign up as ad sponsor <https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata>`_!  
  

Pre-order the PSF Python Brochure  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
We provide two options for pre-ordering the brochure from the second print run
which will be available early in April 2015:  

  1. free `*Community Orders* <https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata>`_ for conference and user groups
  2. paid `*Company Orders* <https://encrypted.evenios.com/en/mediadata>`_ for companies and organizations

The costs for the community orders are sponsored through sponsor ads, the
`PSF <https://www.python.org/psf/>`_ and the company orders.
