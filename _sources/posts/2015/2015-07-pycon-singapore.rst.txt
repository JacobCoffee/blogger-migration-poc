PyCon Singapore
===============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/07/pycon-singapore.html>`_.

The PSF is happy to report that the third annual PyCon Singapore took place
June 17 to 19, 2015. This event, organized by the Python User Group Singapore,
is a testament to the robust presence of the Python community in the Asia-
Pacific region. In addition to three PyCons Singapore, PUGS has held three
PyCons Asia-Pacific. Congratulations to Ivan Zimine and the organizing
committee for a successful conference. According to Ivan, “Feedback from the
participants was mostly positive. Out of 18 responses, 7 people gave 4 out of
5 stars, and 6 people gave 5 out of 5 stars for the “How did you like
PyConSG?” question."

The PSF contributed to the event as a Silver Level Sponsor, and we were proud
that keynote speakers included our own PSF Director Lynn Root and former PSF
Director Jessica McKellar. Django core developer Andrew Godwin also gave a
keynote.

The event was attended by 181 people and was held on the campus of `Singapore
Polytechnic <http://www.sp.edu.sg/wps/portal/vp-spws>`_. It consisted of one day
of tutorials and two days of talks. Tutorials covered topics such topics as
unit testing, data stores, and beginning programming with Python and Django,
and were attended by 96 people, of whom 64 were students. Lynn Root’s
tutorial, “How to Spy with Python,” explained how the NSA and the UK’s Tempora
programs can collect data on citizens' search histories, emails, IRC
conversations, PGP usage, etc. As Lynn was clear to point out, however, the
talk was not an endorsement of spying or a how-to, but rather a “… way of
understanding the current political environment, as well as indirectly
understanding how to protect one’s privacy” (see `How to
Spy <https://pycon.sg/schedule/presentation/36/>`_).

127 people (of whom 41 were students) attended the two days of conference
talks. Featured speakers included Anand Chitipothu, Kristin Nguyen, Ricky
Setyawan, Sacha Goedegebure, Colm O'Connor, and others covering a wide range
of topics, including interpreters, data processing, educational games, data
processing, machine learning, multicore processing, and film production.

A first-time feature of the conference was its edu-summit, which was attended
by approximately 40 Computer Science teachers.

The summit included a talk by Praveen Patil titled "Python in my Physics
classroom"about how to incorporate computer science into the science
curriculum using ExpEYES, an Open Source Pocket Science Lab
(<https://pycon.sg/schedule/presentation/59/>).
