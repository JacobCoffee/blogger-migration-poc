New PSF Community Mailing List
==============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/09/new-psf-community-mailing-list.html>`_.

Last year, the Python Software Foundation adopted an `open membership
model <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_, allowing anyone that uses and
supports Python to become a member of the foundation. Furthering our efforts
on this front, the historical *psf-members* mailing list has been retired,
and two new mailing lists have been created in its place: *psf-community*
and *psf-vote*.  
  
Unlike the old psf-members mailing list, the new psf-community mailing list
will be open to all community members, and will have public archives. The new
psf-vote mailing list will only be used to administer elections. A more
detailed summary of the mailing list changes can be found below, along with
the related resolutions from the PSF board meetings.  

  * The `psf-members mailing list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-members>`_ has been retired:
    * This list will be locked to new posts.
    * This list will no longer accept new subscribers.
    * The archives will be open to existing list subscribers.

  * A new `psf-community mailing list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-community>`_ has been created:
    * All community members may subscribe.
    * The archives are public.
    * This list is expected to be an active list with courteous, productive, and respectful conversations about community issues and news.
    * Example topics: PyCon announcements, PSF board meeting minutes, PSF board member nominations, community awards, outreach and education initiatives, etc
    * All current PSF members have been sent an invite to join this mailing list, and anyone is welcome to `subscribe to this list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-community>`_ (after signing up for a basic membership).

  * A new `psf-vote mailing list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-vote>`_ has been created:
    * All PSF members with `voting privileges <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/#who-is-allowed-to-vote>`_ may subscribe to this list. This includes the following membership classes: supporting members, sponsor delegates, managing members, contributing members, and fellows.
    * The archives will be open to list subscribers.
    * This list will be used to administer PSF elections. We have automatically subscribed all current PSF voters. If you unsubscribe from this list, our secretary will reach out to you to confirm that you wish to relinquish your voting rights.
    * This list is expected to be a low volume mailing list, containing election details, and discussions that require some privacy and discretion (such as a potential corporate sponsors).

We hope to see you on the new psf-community mailing list â€“ thank you for your
contributions to the community!
