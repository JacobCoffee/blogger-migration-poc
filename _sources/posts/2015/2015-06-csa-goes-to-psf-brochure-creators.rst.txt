CSA goes to PSF Brochure Creators
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/06/csa-goes-to-psf-brochure-creators.html>`_.

_RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award Armin Stross-
------------------------------------------------------------------
Radschinski and Jan Ulrich Hasecke the 1st Qtr 2015 PSF Community Service
Award for their work on creating the PSF Python Brochure._

For the last several years, a dedicated team has toiled in obscurity on a task
they knew to be important for the future of a programming language they loved,
but at the same time, one that many thought would be a fool’s errand and would
never pay off. These intrepid visionaries kept going, through thick and thin;
through difficulties getting stories, legal permissions, and sponsors; through
naysayers and those who said, again and again, that it was useless, since
"winter is coming" (or something similar); through lions, and tigers and . . .
! Ultimately, they produced (drumroll, please) *the PSF Brochure*!

All kidding aside, the PSF brochure took an enormous amount of work and has
been a huge success. It stands as a real-world ambassador for Python, for
which we should all be grateful, and of which we should all be aware and
proud! The next time one of your relatives, or friend of a friend, or a new
acquaintance asks "_so why is this open source language you’re spending so
much time on such a big deal?" (see fn.* below),_  you needn’t break a sweat
explaining; just hand them the brochure.

And beyond saving individual Pythonistas a lot of time and effort, the
brochure, more importantly, conveys to “CIOs and chief developers, scientists
and programmers, university lecturers, teachers and students, customers,
clients, managers and employees” the benefits, functions, uses, applications,
advantages, features, potential, and ease of using Python.

Armin worked on the design and layout of the brochure, managed the visual
aspects of the project, getting the sponsor ads into the brochure, managing
the print runs, the project support website, ordering system, payment system,
and finally all the shipping of the brochures to various conferences and user
groups around the world.

Jan Ulrich was the main editor of the brochure content and worked with the
sponsor story authors to create interesting stories. He also wrote the
editorial parts of the brochure: the intro and the "import success" sections.

They both also helped with finding good success stories and sponsors, a task
which took more time and effort than originally anticipated. According to PSF
Director, Marc-Andre Lemburg, who headed up the project,

> Armin and Jan Ulrich both put a huge amount of work into the creation of the
> brochure. Armin on the visual and production side, Jan Ulrich on the
> editorial and content side. Without their efforts and passion, we would not
> have succeeded running this four year project to completion.”
