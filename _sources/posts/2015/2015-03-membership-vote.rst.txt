Membership Vote
===============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/membership-vote.html>`_.

This morning, PSF Director David Mertz announced on the PSF Members' mailing
list the opening of a vote. For those of you who have already self-certified
as voting members, or if you are already a Fellow of the Foundation, you
should have received the announcement in a private email.  
  
This is our first stab at using the voting mechanism to get a sense of the
larger membership's views on an issue currently under discussion (the non-
binding poll), so we urge you to take a moment and make your voice heard.  
  
To review your eligibility to vote and to see the certification form, please
see my previous blog post `Enroll as Voting
Member <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/enroll-as-psf-voting-member.html>`_
or go to the `PSF Website <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_.  
  
Here is the announcement:  

> Membership Vote for Pending Sponsors and Non-Binding Poll

> The candidate Sponsor Members listed below were recommended for approval by
> the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors. Following the ballot
> choices is a detailed description of the organization (the submit button is
> after the descriptions, so scroll down for it).  
>  This election will close on 2015-03-26.  
>  Sponsor Member Candidates  
>  Bloomberg LP|  yes|  no|  abstain  
> ---|---|---|---  
> Fastly|  yes|  no|  abstain  
> Infinite Code|  yes|  no|  abstain  
> Non-Binding Poll on PyCon Video Sublicensing

> *Purpose:*  The PSF Board of Directors is seeking the collective
> perspective of PSF Voting Members on the appropriate handling of video
> recording sublicensing for presentations at PyCon US. These videos are
> currently made freely available on Google's YouTube, and may be incorporated
> into other sites through YouTube's embedding features. There are no plans to
> change that arrangement, but a separate question has arisen that requires
> determining whether it would be appropriate to exercise the sublicensing
> rights granted to the PSF under the PyCon US speaker agreement. This part of
> the poll serves as a non-binding survey of PSF Voting Members, intended to
> help the Directors formulate a suitable policy in this area based on the way
> the PyCon US speaker agreement is generally perceived, rather than based
> solely on what it permits as a matter of law.  
>  *Background:*  A request has been made to the PSF to sublicense video
> recordings made at PyCon of speaker presentations. The license agreement
> signed by speakers gives the PSF the right to grant such sublicenses,
> however the Board of Directors is of mixed opinion about whether we _should_
> do so. The release form (i.e. license) agreed to by speakers is at
> <https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/recording/> for reference. Note that
> YouTube is explicitly mentioned in the release as an example of such a
> sublicensee, and `pyvideo.org <http://pyvideo.org/>`_ has always been given
> this right (although they have only exercised it thus far by embedding
> YouTube hosted videos, not by mirroring content, and hence are not
> technically a sublicensee at this point). Embedding a video does not require
> a sublicense, only mirroring it does.  
>  There are two axes along which the Board is divided. On the one hand, we
> are not unanimous about whether we should grant a sublicense to commercial
> entities which may benefit financially by providing local copies of these
> video recordings, and may even _potentially_  grant such local access only
> to subscribers in some manner. In favor of granting such access, some
> Directors feel that the more widespread the mirroring, the better,
> regardless of the commercial or non-commercial nature of the hosting (i.e.
> as long as the gratis access is never removed, which is not being
> contemplated). In opposition to granting such access, some Directors feel
> that for-profit sublicensees will gain unfair commercial advantage by
> bundling PyCon videos with other content sold for profit. Potentially the
> PSF may require payment, and gain revenue, for granting these sublicense
> rights.  
>  On the other hand, we are also not unanimous about whether—if we do grant
> sublicenses—we should do so only prospectively, once we can inform speakers
> of our intent prior to their talks, or whether we should exercise the rights
> given in speaker releases even retroactively for previous PyCons. While
> speakers have given such rights already in a legal sense, some Directors
> feel they may not have fully contemplated that grant at the time, and only
> going forward, with more explicit information about sublicensing intents of
> the PSF, should sublicensing be allowed to other entities.  
>  Sublicense entities|  Only YouTube (others embedding)|  As many mirrors as
> possible|  Only non-commercial mirrors  
> ---|---|---|---  
> Sublicense timeframe|  Prospectively only|  Including retroactively|  Not
> applicable

> *Fastly*  
>  Fastly provides the PSF with unlimited free CDN services, a dedicated IP
> block, and hosted certificates. We also provide the PSF with free Premium
> Support. Over the last few months, Fastly’s comped services to the PSF
> totalled up to ~$20,000/month. In January 2015 alone, the PSF sent 1.7
> billion requests and 132 TB through Fastly.  
>  Python is a the go-to language at Fastly for building developer tools.
> Python allows Fastly to rapidly prototype and deploy novel protocols and
> services over multiple platforms, including devices like network switches,
> which are traditionally not programmable. Fastly relies on Python for data
> analysis and to dynamically reconfigure network switching and routing to
> steer every request to the closest available server. These tools are
> instrumental in helping Fastly reliably deliver more traffic in less time.

> *Infinite Code*  
>  Infinite Code is a software development firm with offices in Beijing, China
> and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We are strong believers in Free/Open Source
> Software and the people centric principles of Agile Development. Our
> language of choice is Python for software development where possible. Our
> recent Python developments run the range from high volume, real money gaming
> platforms to massively parallel data gathering and transformation for large
> quantities of data. Our developers have been using Python since 2001.
