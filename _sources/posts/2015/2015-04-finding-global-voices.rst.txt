Finding global voices
=====================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/finding-global-voices.html>`_.

On the psf-members mailing list today, current Director David Mertz expressed
some sentiments about increasing diversity in the governance of the foundation
that I'd like to share.  Making the Python community, and the Python Software
Foundation itself, more diverse, globally and across dimensions of privilege
is something we have been striving for very consciously for years. Here's what
he wrote (re-posted with his permission):  

> This year, as for the last bunch of years, I'll be the election
> administrator in the upcoming election. This will have some candidates for
> the Board of Directors of the PSF, and probably a few other issues like
> Sponsor Members approvals or membership resolutions.  
>      This year, as in past Board elections, I will use "approval voting"
> again. This will be explained again when you get ballots and announcements
> here. But the general idea is that each voter can cast as many Approve votes
> as they wish to for the 11 seats. A voter might vote for only the one
> candidate they really like to avoid diluting that vote. Or they might vote
> for every candidate _except_  the one they really don't like as an "anyone
> but" vote. Or, in most cases, voters will vote for some number of candidates
> whom they feel generally comfortable with or prefer, and skip voting for any
> others.  
>      I give this preface to explain how I intend to vote. I am a white,
> male, middle-class, middle-aged, cis-gendered, American who has been on the
> Board for a long while. I may or may not run for it again (my name is on the
> wiki now with no candidate description, but mostly as a placeholder to get
> some permission issues sorted out for editing the wiki).  
>      But what I REALLY want is to have a PSF Board that is less American,
> less white, less male (and ideally represents diversity along other
> dimensions also: religious, sexual identities, linguistic, disability, etc).
> So I earnestly urge any or all PSF members, or their friends and colleagues,
> or other members of the Python community, or general supporters of Free
> Software, who might consider serving on the Board to place themselves in
> nomination, or allow themselves to be so placed.  
>      Serving on the Board is a genuine commitment of time and effort, and
> carries a fiduciary obligation. It's not just an item to put on a resume,
> and I don't want names of Directors from
> `subaltern <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaltern_%28postcolonialism%29>`_*
> groups there just as names alone. But I really do want those names as people
> who actively participate in making our community both more vigorous and more
> diverse.  
>     Which is to say, that for MY own vote, I can pledge to vote Approve to
> any candidate with a minimal indication of commitment to the selfless,
> volunteer tasks involved who doesn't look or sound quite so much like
> myself.  
>      Please, wonderful potential candidates, step up and let me cast these
> votes!

> _[*] In`critical theory <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory>`_ and

> of the `hegemonic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony>`_ `power
> structure <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy>`_ of the
> `colony <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony>`_ and of the colonial
> `homeland <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland>`_. In describing "history
> told from below", the term subaltern derived from `Antonio
> Gramsci <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci>`_'s work on `cultural
> hegemony <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony>`_, which identified
