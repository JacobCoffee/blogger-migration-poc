Meet the Coulson Tough Elementary Python Club
=============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/11/meet-coulson-tough-elementary-python.html>`_.

As we all know, one of the PSF’s main purposes is to educate and advocate for
the use of Python. What makes us so successful in this area is the enthusiasm
with which the community is willing to share its time and knowledge. For me,
hearing these stories is the best part of working with the PSF. We have
recently heard from an educator in Texas who is seriously changing students'
lives by teaching them to code with Python. She is Fifth Grade Science
Teacher, Melissa Dylag, of Coulson Tough Elementary School, a K - 6th school
in South East Texas.

Melissa’s adventure started in 2013 when she was approached by a parent who
urged her to introduce her students to the world of coding and computer
science. Using the non-profit `Code.org <https://code.org/about>`_  tutorial,
`"Hour of Code," <https://hourofcode.com/us>`_  Melissa taught each of her fifth
grade classes for three days. Melissa inspired Technology teachers Noreen Reid
and Shelley Moya, who in turn taught other students; by last year, almost
every student in the school (about 1000) had completed an hour of computer
science instruction via the free website.

The students' response was fantastic, so Melissa wanted to do more to empower
her students. She recruited the help of her son (a recent computer science
graduate and now a Silicon Valley software engineer) to develop a full intro
course using Python. According to Melissa, Python was a good choice because it
"offers my students everything to build a proper foundation for future
computer science instruction."

Melissa, along with helpers Noreen and Shelley, are learning Python as they
go. They teach about 30 students, an approximately equal mix of boys and girls
in 4th, 5th and 6th grades, every Wednesday morning before the regular school
day. Kids and teachers in the "Python Club" are loving it–they’re even making
T-shirts.  

"Children are coming to school over 45 minutes early in the morning to code.
We have a line of cars at 6:50 in the morning for students that can’t wait to
come in to code. PYTHON is a huge success and I am turning children away
because we don’t have enough computers in the lab to accommodate them all."

Melissa shared with us some of her recent `Python Club lessons
 <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Htg3y8i1QanhRWaR1U7oh0EYCaVYj8vyvTIt3BnGZG8/edit?usp=sharing>`_lessons.
Please take a look--I think they're terrific. (I was especially impressed with
the wisdom of one of her early slides: "The biggest challenge in coding is to
learn how to make changes and how to recover if the changes fail.")

The parents are also thrilled. One parent emailed that her 6th grade daughter
"…has really enjoyed learning programming. She takes a picture of what she
does on Wednesday mornings and can’t wait to show me what she has created…. I
love that this club is exposing girls to programming."

Melissa plans to expand to offer two classes next year: an advanced class so
that this year’s students can continue, and another introductory one. She
needs to get approval from her administration, but she is enthusiastic and
determined.

"I want to do what is best for the children. We all love PYTHON and we are
thrilled to share what we are learning… We are pumped to be a PYTHON school."

Please join me in thanking Melissa, her helpers, students, and all the
teachers like her. We are "pumped" to have them as part of our community!
