Brian Costlow, “the quietly amazing rock” Python volunteer: Community Service Award Recipient
=============================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/04/brian-costlow-quietly-amazing-rock.html>`_.

Brian began volunteering unofficially, when he threw out a pile of pizza
boxes. He was at `PyOhio <https://pyohio.org/>`_ in 2009 when, as Brian recalls,
“Lunch was delivered pizza and the organizers had to clean up after the
conference. I felt bad that I had attended a great event, entirely free, so I
started to help them sweep the floors and throw away the pizza boxes." The
next two years Brian worked the conference as a volunteer. In 2012 he joined
the organizing committee and he went on to chair the conference in 2014, 2015,
and 2016.

A Jack-Of-All-Trades PyOhio Organizer

“I was working in IT for a large printing and media company when I started to
use Python for a number of projects. I joined the Ohio Python Mailing List and
when the planning for the first PyOhio began, I made plans to attend,” Brian
recalls. Regrettably Brian was unable to attend the inaugural PyOhio
conference. He did, however, attend the second PyOhio, where his volunteerism
began with a simple act of cleaning empty pizza boxes. Since 2010 Brian has
worked alongside PyOhio organizers like Catherine Devlin and Eric Floehr, the
founder of the Central Ohio Python User Group, chairing the conference,
recruiting workshops, seeking new speakers.

`Katie Cunningham <http://therealkatie.net/>`_, one of the leaders of the `Young
Coders <https://us.pycon.org/2016/events/letslearnpython/>`_ project, first met
Brian when he invited Young Coders to join PyOhio. During their first year
Young Coders encountered a few technical hiccups. Cunningham recalls, “Brian
wasn’t fazed. He helped keep the room together." She adds that “he is one of
those quietly amazing people who quickly goes from someone you know to someone
you couldn't do without. In an industry rife with people who tend to be a bit
flighty, he's a rock”.

On a personal note, I first attended PyOhio in 2015 as both an inaugural
speaker and attendee. I was terrified. Following my talk I had the pleasure to
meet Brian. He was excited to hear about my experience as a novice speaker and
we continued our discussion after the conference. Brian has been continuously
interested in learning how to recruit more women and underrepresented
individuals to both attend and speak at PyOhio. What makes PyOhio unique as a
place to begin one’s speaking or Python career is the simple fact that PyOhio
is free to attend. According to Brian, PyOhio never deliberately set out to be
accessible, “it just happened organically because the Python community really
is a community, and we all wanted to give back to the community that gave so
much to us”.

Continuing to Give Back at PyCon through Captioning

`Brandon Rhodes <https://us.pycon.org/2016/about/staff/>`_, PyCon 2016 and 2017
chair, reached out to Brian a year early in 2015 seeking assistance with
captioning. Brian, mindful of Rhodes's support for PyOhio, says, “Brandon has
always been a great friend to PyOhio. So when he was selected as chair for
PyCon 2016 and 2017, I reached out and said if there was anything I could help
him with, I would gladly do it."

Captioning was a remote volunteer position in 2015. “Brian first helped out in
Montreal and then took the lead in 2016 at Portland. Every year Brian takes
part in the process, takes careful observations, and notes what works and what
doesn’t,” Ewa Jodlowska explains. Given some of Brian’s feedback and other
lessons learned at 2015 the PyCon organizing team opened to turn the
captioning position into a staff position. “We learn lots year after year and
make several improvements thanks to Brian's involvement,” Jodlowska adds.

Brian continues to work with the captioning staff team. He says, “If someone
wants to get involved, just reach out to Ewa or me, we're always open to
suggestions for improvement!"

Brian Costlow, by his willingness to work behind the scenes on jobs big and
small, demonstrates the spirit of Python's community. It’s about supporting
one another and always looking forward to doing things better and bigger that
makes the community so vibrant.

Look for Brian at PyCon 2017! He may just want to share with you some exciting
ways you can help with PyCon captioning in the future.
