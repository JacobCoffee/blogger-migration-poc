Sponsors help keep PyCon affordable and accessible to the widest possible
audience. Sponsors are what make this conference possible. From low ticket
prices to financial aid, to video recording, the organizations who step
forward to support PyCon, in turn, support the entire Python community. They
make it possible for so many to attend, for so many to be presenters, and for
the people at home to watch along.  
  
The benefits of sponsorship are many - here are a few to consider:  

  * Being part of the biggest and most prestigious Python conference in the world. 
  * Being matched with those who could potentially become clients. 
  * Staying in front of your current customers - 3300+ attendees will see your products. 
  * Building relationships with the Python community - people look to sponsors to see who is using and supporting Python. 
  * Recruiting - if you’re hiring, PyCon is the place to be. 
  * A private meeting or interview room to conduct business onsite. 
  * The opportunity for innovators and practitioners in your company to talk about how you’re using Python. 

Depending on your level of sponsorship, packages include complimentary
conference passes, booth space, lead retrieval scanners, speaking
opportunities, and a table in the Job Fair.  
  
We’re flexible and willing to work with you to design the sponsorship package
to fulfill your business needs. Starting a discussion now is a great way to
design a more custom program for you. Our sponsorship prospectus can be found
