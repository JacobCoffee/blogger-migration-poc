Community is at its Peak at North Bay Python
============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/12/community-is-at-its-peak-at-north-bay.html>`_.

As I sat in the cool, darkened theater, I reflected on what had brought me to
North Bay Python. While I had heard the buzz about a Python conference in
Petaluma, it wasn‚Äôt until PyLadies Vancouver offered me a free ticket that I
decided to attend. A quick flight from Seattle brought me to San Francisco the
night before North Bay Python started, allowing me time to partake in one of
my favorite hobbies -  navigating public transit to new places. Sitting in the
theater I felt lucky. Though I had attended a variety of Geographic
Information Systems conferences, this was my first Python conference outside
of PyData Seattle and local meetups. I could not wait for what was in store.

Nestled in the heart of wine country in Sonoma County, roughly 40 miles north
of San Francisco, sits the Mystic Theatre in Petaluma. Built in 1911 and
normally hosting theater and music shows, the theater is not the usual host
for a tech conference. Christopher Neugebauer, an organizer of North Bay
Python, originally had the idea to hold a conference at the Mystic Theatre
earlier this year as he was talking to friends at PyCon. By the end of PyCon
2017 it was decided, and planning had begun for the first annual North Bay
Python conference.

The historic venue wasn‚Äôt the only thing special about this conference. Before
the talks began, Christopher got on stage and informed us of the `code of
conduct, <https://2017.northbaypython.org/code-of-conduct>`_ photo sensitivity
policies, all-gender bathrooms, quiet spaces, and nursing room. We were
provided a number to call if at any time during the conference we felt unsafe.
Next, Josh Simmons, another organizer, asked the audience, ‚ÄúWho here is
attending a technical conference for the first time?‚Äù Roughly 40% of the 230
attendees raised their hand, shocking the organizers at the overwhelming
percentage of newcomers. Thus the largest developer conference held in Sonoma
County was also, perhaps, its most welcoming.

This single-track conference offered a relevant and diverse range of topics
including security considerations, using Python to orchestrate libraries
written in Fortran and C, demystifying iterators, and developing good
leadership practices. Keynote `Brandon
Rhodes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrMnmLyYjU8>`_, having received many
questions about his PyCon 2017 slides, which he ran completely inside a
terminal, gave an overview of why and how he made them. Keynote `Carina C.
Zona <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHyzM6pYmyQ&t=2s>`_ presented a compelling
case for 2 Factor Authentication (2FA), as well as guidance on how to make 2FA
more user-friendly and inclusive. Some of my favorite talks were those that
had the audience in stitches. `Melanie
Crutchfield <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxCp3Ciwjm0>`_‚Äôs talk entitled
‚ÄúStumbling Through Django and How Not To‚Äù took us through her process of
building a Django application and lessons she learned so that we don‚Äôt have
to, was full of hilarious analogies and delightful hand-drawn slides. `Benno
Rice <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7oJyU2iFhA>`_‚Äôs talk, ‚ÄúA Young Twitter
Bot's Illustrated Primer‚Äù, walked us through his adventures with Twitter bots,
which was not only informative but peppered with ridiculous bot-generated
tweets.

While planning the `schedule <https://2017.northbaypython.org/schedule/>`_,
Christopher and the other organizers had a shortlist of keynote speakers in
mind. "We were lucky enough to get our first two choices!‚Äù said Christopher.
For the remaining talks, they put together a call for proposals, offering
support for those interested in speaking through workshops and feedback
sessions. In the end, they ran a blind review process which anonymized
proposals to compensate for biases. The organizers were very pleased with the
result as Christopher explained, ‚Äúwe ended up with an astonishingly high-
quality program that included new speakers and a community representation that
we are really proud of."

In terms of networking opportunities, North Bay Python provided a wiki for
people to use to gather in Birds of a Feather groups. Others used Twitter to
find people to have lunch or dinner with. Additionally, the organizers
collaborated with `PyLadies San Francisco <https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF>`_
and `PyLadies Silicon Valley <https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Silicon-Valley>`_
to hold a PyLadies lunch on the first day of the conference, free of charge
and open to all PyLadies in attendance and their supporters.

`Rachel Kelly <https://twitter.com/wholemilk>`_, a DevOps engineer at
`Bright.md <http://bright.md/>`_ and seasoned conference goer noticed many
special things about this conference. ‚ÄúI have never seen a nursing room at a
conference before‚Äù, she said, ‚Äúand I have been to what are undoubtedly some of
the world‚Äôs most inclusive conferences.‚Äù She went on to say, ‚Äúthe code of
conduct was not only a requirement for attendance, it was reinforced at the
beginning and touched on throughout the weekend, sometimes personally from the
organizers.‚Äù The single-track of the conference was also much appreciated, she
noted, ‚ÄúI loved being able to focus on and watch every single talk, something
we are rarely afforded at technical conferences.‚Äù

So will they do it again next year? ‚ÄúAbsolutely!‚Äù said Christopher, ‚Äúour first
conference felt really special, and we can‚Äôt wait to share Petaluma and this
experience with even more people in 2018.‚Äù
