The PyLady Behind PyLadies: Lynn Root, Community Service Award 2nd Quarter 2017 Recipient
=========================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/09/the-pylady-behind-pyladies-lynn-root.html>`_.

PyLadies is an international mentorship community for women that use Python.
Started with a grant in 2011, PyLadies has continued to bring women into the
Python community through a variety of methods, including hosting events in
local PyLadies chapters as well as offering a grant opportunity to attend
PyCon. One woman in particular has contributed to PyLadies' success, for which
the PSF recognized her as a Community Service Award recipient for the 2nd
Quarter of 2017:  

> _RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation Q2 2017 Community Service
> Award to_ _Lynn Root for her work as the founder of the San Francisco
> Chapter of PyLadies, a member_ _of the Django Software Foundation, and as a
> tireless volunteer at PyCon._

PyLadies in the early days, the Start of the San Francisco Chapter

  

If you can name one person associated with PyLadies, it is Lynn Root. Lynn’s
relentless support, organizing, and evangelizing on behalf of PyLadies is
known by many. “Lynn’s enthusiasm and passion for bringing more women into
tech are well complemented by her organizational skills, which were especially
needed at pivotal moment in early PyLadies history. Lynn helped grow PyLadies
into, what is now, a global organization that’s had a huge impact on the
Python community,” PyLady Esther Nam, one of the founders of the PyLadies Los
Angeles chapter, explains.

In late 2011, Lynn began learning to program, as some of graduate programs she
was considering required her to have some programming expertise. “I reached
out to San Francisco’s Women Who Code to organize a Python study group,” Lynn
recalls, trying to find like-minded women to join. She had used Python in a
weekend hackathon and found it to be a beginner friendly language. The
following year, in 2012, PyCon was held in Santa Clara.  “Lynn reached out and
organized a carpool of Bay Area Pythonistas to attend the conference”, Esther
remembers. PyLadies from the first chapter in Los Angeles attended, where Lynn
met with them to learn more about PyLadies.  The next month, she founded the
San Francisco chapter. Lynn continued to act as a principal organizer for
PyLadies San Francisco for the next four years.

with her time as PyLadies San Francisco lead organizer, Lynn championed other
significant projects including the creation of ``pip install
pyladies <http://www.pyladies.com/blog/pip-install-pyladies/>`_`, the PyLadies
open source kit for new organizers. The development of open source tools for
PyLadies has been instrumental in getting the word out about PyLadies. Lynn
was able to use these tools to help start international PyLadies communities
in Stockholm, Zagreb, and Brno.

  

Lynn also took an active role in bringing PyLadies content to PyCon. During
Lynn’s first term on the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors in 2013
to 2014, Lynn helped plan and run the first `PyLadies Charity
Auction <http://www.pyladies.com/blog/PyLadies--PyCon---Join-Us/PyLadies-at-
PyCon-2013/>`_ at PyCon. Months of work go into organizing the charity auction;
it requires donations to be procured beforehand, besides auctioneering on-
site. The inaugural PyLadies Charity Auction raised $10,000.00 USD for
PyLadies. Commenting in a `2013 press release about the
auction <http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/-1771597.htm>`_, Atlanta
PyLadies founder Laura Cassell explains, “we're all so resourceful already
that I suspect this money is going to go a long way towards helping women who
want to get into the industry. I'm still a little misty-eyed at the whole
thing, to be honest."

Besides her PyLadies work, Lynn has been a speaker at PyCon `four
times <http://pyvideo.org/speaker/lynn-root.html>`_, PyCon `Lightning Talk
Chair <https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/staff/>`_ since 2014, frequent session
runner, and recurring PyCon volunteer.

PyLadies Benevolent Dictator for Life?

I asked Lynn if she has ever been called the PyLadies Benevolent Dictator for
Life (`BDFL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life>`_).
Lynn shook her head, she does not see herself in that fashion. But it is hard
to refute the strong footprint she has left on the PyLadies community. Lynn
has written several Python open source tutorials, like the `web scraping with
scrapy and postgres <http://newcoder.io/scrape/>`_, that are often used in
PyLadies workshops and are highly visited (over 65,000 times to date this
year!), and has spoken at PyCons around the world: EuroPython, PyCon Finland,
and PyCon Brasil. Lynn was the original PyLady I consulted with when starting
the PyLadies Chicago chapter in 2014.

From founding her local PyLadies chapter, to volunteering at PyCon, to
catalyzing other initiatives like the Django Software Foundation, Lynn has
been an unwavering advocate for women in the Python community and for the
broader Python community itself. The thing that Lynn says has been most
satisfying for her as a Python community organizer and advocate has been the
rise of women in Python. “In 2012 only 8% of speakers at PyCon were women now
in 2017 we have approximately 33%”.  
  

With the rise of PyLadies at PyCon and throughout the world, it’ll be exciting
to see what comes next for the PyLadies community and for those that have
helped make PyLadies such a tremendous success.
