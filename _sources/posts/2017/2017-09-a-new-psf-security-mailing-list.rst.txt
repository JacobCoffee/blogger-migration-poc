A New Python Security Mailing List
==================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/09/a-new-psf-security-mailing-list.html>`_.

The Python community takes security very seriously. In an effort to enhance
security and promote transparency about security matters, the `Python Security
Response Team <https://www.python.org/news/security/>`_ (PSRT) has created a
`security-announce <https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/security-
announce.python.org/>`_ mailing list. This mailing list will allow the PSRT to
communicate about security-related matters to anyone in the Python community
who signs up. Join this list to stay on top of the most recent `security
fixes <https://python-security.readthedocs.io/>`_ to the Python language. Click
`here <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-
dev/2017-September/149618.html>`_ to learn more about the mailing list and to
sign up!
