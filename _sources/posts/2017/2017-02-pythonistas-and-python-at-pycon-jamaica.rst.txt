Pythonistas (and a Python!) at PyCon Jamaica
============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/02/pythonistas-and-python-at-pycon-jamaica.html>`_.

  

This past November marked the first `PyCon
Jamaica <https://www.pythonjam.org.jm/conference-2016/schedule>`_. Held in the
capital, Kingston, the conference began on November 17th with a day of
tutorials followed by a single track of talks on November 18th. I attended
both as a representative of the Python Software Foundation, which sponsored
the conference, and as a speaker.  

Python in Kingston’s Higher Education

Kingston, home to approximately 33% of Jamaicans, boasts several institutions
of higher learning including the Caribbean Maritime Institute and the Mona
campus of the University of the West Indies. PyCon Jamaica kicked off with
tutorials at the University of the West Indies. Most of the tutorials focused
on introductory topics (e.g. Introduction to Plone). Participants came from a
wide range of backgrounds including mechanical engineers or undergraduates
with a marketing concentration. Interestingly I was informed Python isn’t a
part of the standard computer science offering at the university yet it has
become a language of considerable interest in many of Kingston’s professional
sectors.

`David Bain <https://twitter.com/pigeonflight>`_, organizer of PyCon Jamaica and
the local `Python Jamaica <https://twitter.com/PythonJamaica>`_ user group,
explained that he thinks the interest in Python has risen as students have
become increasingly exposed to web technologies. Bain added that PyCon Jamaica
is a way to help demonstrate to students and professionals the various
applications Python has. "Jamaica wants to be seen as a viable source for
local and North American nearshore developer talent, our event signals that
software development talent is here," Bain explained.

  

Modernizing the Public Sector with Python
-----------------------------------------

  

Conference talks were held at the Hope Zoo, a facility housing vast botanical
gardens, a zoo, and a community center. There were three international
speakers, `Joir-dan Gumbs <https://twitter.com/jagumbs>`_ of IBM, `Star
Ying <https://twitter.com/star_is_here>`_ of the US Dept of Commerce, and
myself, alongside several local speakers. The tutorials had been more student-
centric, but the conference catered to those using Python in the Jamaican
public sector.

A common theme from local speakers highlighted how Python has helped local
professionals modernize outdated practices. Marc Murray of the Jamaican
Ministry of Health described how he has used Python throughout his career of
fifteen-plus years to automate processes and enable better data collection and
data sharing. More than one speaker acknowledged that struggle of
institutional knowledge silos in the local government. With Python, though,
these knowledge silos have started to be disrupted. Agencies are able to share
the same data sets with greater ease and promote transparency.

Python's data-processing power was the star in a talk by student `Dominic
Mills <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLZtMGJF--8>`_. Mills recently completed
an internship at CERN, where he built a Django prototype for debugging
hardware in future experiments. Crucial to this project was not only the
collection of data via Celery but the capacity to analyze it. Mills used bokeh
for real time analysis of the sensor data, permitting monitoring and alarms to
be raised if unfavorable conditions were found.

Collectively the speakers at PyCon Jamaica reflect how Jamaican programmers
are embracing Python for data collection and analysis in a variety of
specialties. Python’s open source packages and rich community support seemed
to be its biggest selling points. Speaker Joir-dan Gumbs commented that, “the
best part for me was the presentations of how Python is enhancing the lives of
Jamaicans, as well as the networking.”

I’m excited to see what PyCon Jamaica 2017 will hold. Already the conference
is rich in data science and data visualization content. After all, if PyCon
Jamaica 2016 included an appearance from the Hope Zoo’s `own
python <https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/799749120089092097>`_ what
will we see next? Perhaps two pythons, and of course many more Jamaican
Pythonistas.
