*Python in Nigeria*
---------------------

  

In 2015, the PSF sponsored the first Python event in Nigeria - the Codesses
Workshop in Lagos. In 2016, the number of events increased to 13, and there
have been 28 events funded so far in 2017! What has happened in the last 2 ½
years to create such a demand for learning Python in this part of the world?

I spoke with Aisha Bello about this. She serves as vice-chair for the Python
Nigeria community. She has helped co-organize and support a number of Django
Girls workshops in Namibia and Nigeria, and also co-organizes PyLadies
Nigeria. Aisha is enthusiastic about the  Python community, with a strong
desire and passion for social change, women’s tech education and empowerment
in Africa. She currently works as an Associate Systems Engineer for Cisco
Systems.

Sharing his thoughts as well, is Chukwudi Nwachukwu, PSF Board Director, and
Team Lead Integrations, TechAdvance. He is also a volunteer member of the PSF
Grants Work Group, helping to review requests from Africa and all over the
world. He has also been invited to speak at PyCon NG in September. When I
asked why he’s passionate about Python, he said, “Python is easy on the brain
and I thank Guido [van Rossum]for such a concept.”

*Python + Community*

According to Aisha, Python is popular in Nigeria because it’s one of the
easiest ways to learn programming. Knowing how to code opens up many career
options. The advantages of open source software are becoming more well-known
in this region, and have allowed the community to grow because they’re not
tied to any one vendor. She notes: “What we have is community. It means a lot
to people that there is a common place or forum where they’re not afraid to
share their struggles and ideas with people with like minds. We took the
Python language and community and made it our own.”

Chukwudi believes that “the recent urge for more women to be in the workforce
of Nigeria through IT has been a huge factor in the growth of Python
programming. The Federal Government of Nigeria has also keyed into this drive
by choosing Flask as a framework of choice to be taught in their Npower
programme.” In addition, Django Girls events nationwide, startup companies
incorporating Python as part of their stack, and IT companies training people
to code in Python, have all made Python a leading programming language in
Nigeria.

  
*Funding for Events*

**  
**  

Aisha and Chukwudi agree that getting funding for events in Nigeria is
challenging. Often, it’s startups that come forward to help sponsor events.
Aisha believes that “By creating more awareness and putting ourselves more out
there, we’re hopeful things will change. Organizations like Github, the PSF,
and the Django Software Foundation believe in us, and sponsor our events even
when no one else will.”

*  
*  

Fortunately, the Django Girls Foundation offers help through their
`Organizer’s Manual <https://organize.djangogirls.org/>`_ and a template for how
to run a workshop: the `Coaching Manual <https://coach.djangogirls.org/>`_.
These documents provide a framework to help groups get started. Having a
professional-looking proposal goes a long way toward convincing organizations
to support these events.

*Positive Outcomes*

*  
*  

Many of the participants of these workshops have gone into IT careers,
received internships, become mentors, organized workshops, and are actively
involved in helping out the community.  Outreach to girls in primary and high
schools is working too. Girls are learning to program in Python, and most
importantly, they’re learning how to use the tools to continue in their
journey toward a career.

*  
*  

One very real example is what `Abocoders <http://abocoders.org.ng/>`_ did in
collaboration with DjangoGirls in Lagos. Girls who had been displaced from
their homes due to Bokoharam in the North were able to learn about computers
and programming. In addition, they each got a refurbished computer to use
during and after the workshop.

GirlCodersRock came out of one of the events. An attendee of a Django Girls
===========================================================================
event in Nigeria is now an intern at TechAdvance, where Chukwudi works. She’s
now coding Python full time. There are many Python-related jobs being
advertised right now in Nigeria - Google Nigeria and Upperlink are hiring, and
Alljobs.ng has 40+ listings. It looks like the trend will continue.

*  
*  

Chukwudi has seen a large increase in members both on slack channels and
mailing lists. The community is very excited about the first PyCon Nigeria,
September 15-16, 2017, in Lagos. It’s the largest gathering for the Python
community in Nigeria, and is organised by members of the Python Users Nigeria
Group, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to advancing and promoting the use
of the Python programming language in the country.

Chukwudi suggested that I speak with a woman he mentors, Hamdalah Adetunji,
about her road to a career in programming. She explained: “It is all a step
towards growth and progress, but I hope one day in the near future, I get to
do more than wish I wasn't the only female on the team. I hope to mentor women
to give back the amazing support I have received all through my journey, and
also let them know they can be anything they want to be as long as they are
focused and determined."
