Four issue trackers submitted for Infrastructure Committee's tracker search
===========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/08/four-issue-trackers-submitted-for.html>`_.

Back in June, the Python Software Foundation's Infrastructure Committee `asked
for help <http://wiki.python.org/moin/CallForTrackers>`_ in the search for a new
issue tracker to replace
`SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470>`_. We asked people
who wished to help with the search to install their favourite issue tracker
and import a data dump of our issues from SourceForge. We placed a deadline of
August 7th to have the installation up and going. We realized that this was a
large request to make of the community, but we needed to make sure that we got
to evaluate any candidate trackers with the amount of issues that Python has
so as to get a real-world feel. Not surprisingly, the community stepped up to
the challenge with four different test tracker installations by the deadline!
We have one for `JIRA <http://jira.python.atlassian.com/>`_,
`Roundup <http://efod.se/python-tracker/>`_, `Trac <http://python-
trac.swapoff.org/>`_, and
`Launchpad <https://demo.launchpad.net/products/python/+bugs>`_. The current
schedule calls for the Infrastructure Committee to spend the next month
evaluating the four trackers and making a decision on which one to go with.
This might slip, though, since this overlaps with traditional American and
European vacation time. But the slippage will not go beyond October 1. On
behalf of the Infrastructure Committee, I thank the people who took the time
and effort to set up a test tracker to help improve the development of Python.
