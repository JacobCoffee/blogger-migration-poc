PyCon 2006 presentations online
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/04/pycon-2006-presentations-online.html>`_.

Some of the `presentations from PyCon
2006 <http://www.python.org/pycon/2006/papers/>`_ are now available from
www.python.org. Unfortunately not all of the authors have made their
presentations available, but about half of the presentations are there.

If you presented a talk at PyCon and want to have your slides added to the
archive, please e-mail them to (webmaster at python.org). HTML is preferred
and PDF is OK; PowerPoint or OpenOffice presentations will also be accepted.

\-- Andrew Kuchling, chair, PyCon 2006.
