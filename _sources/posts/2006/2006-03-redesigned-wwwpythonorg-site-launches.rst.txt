Redesigned www.python.org site launches
=======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/03/redesigned-wwwpythonorg-site-launches.html>`_.

Today the PSF is pleased to announce a redesigned version of
`www.python.org <http://www.python.org>`_.

The new page design was created by Tim Parkin of `Pollenation
Internet <http://www.pollenation.net>`_. It uses modern CSS for page styling,
making it possible to choose between normal and large-font versions of the
site, and suppressing the page headers and sidebars in the printed version.
Try previewing the printed version of a page to see the effect.

Pages are now closer to being valid XHTML 1.0, though not quite -- there was a
_lot_ of content to convert. Much conversion work was done by the participants
in the pydotorg sprint at PyCon 2006.

We welcome comments and bug reports for the new site. Please see the `'About
the website' <http://www.python.org/about/website/>`_ page for instructions on
creating a new problem ticket. You can also send e-mail to the address
<webmaster at python.org>.
