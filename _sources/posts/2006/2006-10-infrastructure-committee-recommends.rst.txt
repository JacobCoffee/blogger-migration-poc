Infrastructure committee recommends a new bug tracker for Python
================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/10/infrastructure-committee-recommends.html>`_.

Brett Cannon, chair of the infrastructure commitee, has posted `the
committee's recommendation <http://sayspy.blogspot.com/2006/10/psf-
infrastructure-committee.html>`_ for a new bug tracker.

The PSF thanks everyone who set up a bug tracker and performed a trial import
of Python's bug database -- a considerable amount of effort on their part.
