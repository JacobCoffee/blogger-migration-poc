A request for trackers from the Infrastructure Committee
========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/05/request-for-trackers-from.html>`_.

Currently Python's bug/patch tracker is hosted on
`SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5470>`_. While it has
served its purpose over the years, the decision has been made that it is time
to move on to another tracker. The Python Software Foundation's Infrastructure
Committee has been charged with selecting a new tracker to use for Python's
development. To do this, the committee is asking for volunteers in setting up
test trackers. Candidate trackers are to load data from a dump of the current
bug data from SourceForge. In this way, the committee can properly evaluate
the plethora of trackers that are available. If you think you can help by
installing and maintaining a test tracker for the duration of the evaluation
period, please see the `detailed
request <http://wiki.python.org/moin/CallForTrackers>`_ on the Python wiki.
Thanks to anyone who is able to help out.
