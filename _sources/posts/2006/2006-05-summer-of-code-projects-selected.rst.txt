Summer of Code projects selected
================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/05/summer-of-code-projects-selected.html>`_.

A slate of Python-related projects has now been selected for Google's `Summer
of Code <http://code.google.com/soc/>`_ initiative.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) was allocated 25 projects, tying with the
Apache Software Foundation for the largest number of funded proposals. The
PSF's `list of the accepted
projects <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode>`_ is now public.

The accepted projects include 5 enhancements to the CPython interpreter or
standard library, 3 `PyPy <http://codespeak.net/pypy/>`_ projects, 3
`SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ projects, and 2 projects relating to the
`Soya3D <http://www.soya3d.org>`_ library for 3-dimensional graphics. There are
also individual projects to enhance PyGame, SQLAlchemy, Python support in
Eclipse, and Mailman; to port the Cells extension for object-oriented
programming from Common Lisp to Python; to add automated code analysis to the
`Python Package Index <http://cheeseshop.python.org>`_; and to write a Python
API for Mozilla browser plug-ins.

The PSF would like to thank everyone who helped assess and rank proposals, and
all the volunteer mentors who offered to assist students with their projects.
