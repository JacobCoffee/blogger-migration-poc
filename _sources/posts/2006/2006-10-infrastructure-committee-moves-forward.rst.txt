Infrastructure committee moves forward with Roundup as the issue tracker for Python
===================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/10/infrastructure-committee-moves-forward.html>`_.

In a `previous post <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/10/infrastructure-
committee-recommends.html>`_ we pointed out that the Infrastructure committee
had come to a recommendation for a new issue tracker for Python development.
As part of that recommendation we stated that if enough volunteer
administrators stepped forward to help administer a tracker installation the
recommendation would switch from
`JIRA <http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/>`_ to
`Roundup <http://roundup.sourceforge.net/>`_. I am happy to report that more
than enough volunteers stepped forward! Four admins (Paul DuBois, Erik
Forsberg, Stefan Seefeld, and Michael Twomey) have been chosen to initially
lead the handling of the tracker. We have also accepted a generous offer made
by `Upfront Systems <http://www.upfrontsystems.co.za/>`_ to host the tracker.
Our next steps are to begin planning out how to administer the installation,
what we want from the tracker, and how to migrate off of SourceForge. These
discussions will take place on the `tracker-
discuss <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tracker-discuss>`_ mailing list
to make sure that the tracker meets the needs of the Python development team.
Thanks to all of those people who came forward to volunteer for the tracker to
make all of this come together!
