Python and Open Source Alive and Well in Havana, Cuba
=====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/05/python-and-open-source-alive-and-well.html>`_.

I recently had the amazing opportunity to travel to Havana, Cuba to attend
several free software events. My partner, David Mertz, was invited to talk at
a meet-up of open-software developers and to present at the `International
Conference of Free Software <http://www.cubaconf.org/>`_ sponsored by the `Grupo
de Usarios de Technologias Libres <http://gutl.jovenclub.cu/>`_.

On my first day in Cuba, I attended the tenth "`Encuentro Social de
Desarrolladores <http://encuentrodesarrolladores.com/all-esd-events/esd-10>`_."
This group, a regular meet-up of open-software developers, just last month
held the first "PyDay Havana." At the meeting I attended, approximately 70
people gathered at a local Havana restaurant, La Casa de Potin. I was told
that more people were interested in attending, but the space was limited so
advance registration was cut off at 70. Several members of the enthusiastic
crowd sported PyCon T-shirts--many from PyCon Montreal, perhaps as one could
expect, but one from as far back as PyCon Chicago in 2009 ("elegance begets
simplicity"). Clearly, this group has been using Python for quite awhile.

I met some wonderful people there: not only Olemis Lang and Medardo Antonio
Rodriguez, members of the PSF’s Python-Cuba Work Group with whom I had been in
touch previously, but also entrepreneurs and developers who regularly use free
software. Justin, a graduate student in Astronomy at Yale, is spending several
months in Cuba on a research project using Python.

Another new connection I made is Abel Meneses Abad, a Computer Science
professor at `Central University of Las Villas in Santa Clara,
Cuba. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_%22Marta_Abreu%22_of_Las_Villas>`_
He told me about his use of Python with his students in Linguistics and his
desire to share his experiences and get input from the larger Python
community. We should be hearing more from him in the future.

The `agenda <http://encuentrodesarrolladores.com/all-esd-events/esd-10>`_ for
the meet-up included talks by Olemis Lang on Brython (and how to sign up for a
Brython sprint to be held at the next week’s CubaConf) and by David Mertz on
functional programming in Python.

Medardo and Stripe Atlas reps address the meet-up  
  
But the talk that garnered the most discussion was a presentation given by
Medardo Rodriguez from `Merchise Start-Ups <http://www.meetup.com/merchise/>`_
on how to start an online business. He was joined by representatives from the
San Francisco-based company `Stripe <https://stripe.com/>`_, which provides
payment processing and business services for start-ups. Their newly launched
service, `Stripe Atlas <https://stripe.com/atlas/faq>`_, helps foreign online
businesses incorporate in Delaware, MD, enabling them to take advantage of the
well-developed business infrastructure in the U.S.  
  
The overall mood of the meet-up was incredibly optimistic–surely a
foreshadowing of the positive changes about to take place for Cuban software
developers as more intercourse develops with the rest of the world and
especially with the U.S. This is a community poised to grow, and I am beyond
thrilled that the PSF will be a part of this.
