CubaConf, Day 1
===============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/05/cubaconf-day-1.html>`_.

_This is the second in a series of posts on my trip in April to Havana, Cuba
to attend`CubaConf <http://www.cubaconf.org/>`_, an International Conference on
Free Software. _

Day one of` CubaConf <http://www.cubaconf.org/>`_ started out with a bit of
confusion. A last minute change of venue was necessary due to some
bureaucratic red tape surrounding the government controlled `Palacio del
Segundo Cabo <http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=306>`_.
Luckily, a short walk across the Plaza de Armas, `the Colegia San
Geronimo <http://www.ohch.cu/instituciones/colegio-san-geronimo/>`_ was
available and happy to step in to provide meeting rooms for the approximately
180 speakers and attendees. And in spite of the spotty internet service that
plagues the island, difficulties in communicating the change did not prevent
the conference from starting smoothly and nearly on schedule. The organizers,
including `Pablo Mestre <https://twitter.com/elmor3no_>`_, a member of the PSF-
Cuba workgroup, deserve much credit for their smooth handling of the
situation.  
  
Preliminary announcements and welcoming remarks revealed that speakers and
attendees came from 17 different countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Canada, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Peru,
Spain, Turkey, Uruguay, United States, and Venezuela.
`Sponsors <http://www.cubaconf.org/2016/03/11/mapbox-is-sponsoring/>`_,
including the PSF, were mentioned and thanked.

The keynote by `Hamlet López
García <http://temas.cult.cu/autor/84/hamlet-l%C3%B3pez-garc%C3%ADa>`_, a social
psychologist from the Cuban Institute of Cultural Research at Juan Marinello,
explored the relationship between free software and Cuba’s politics and
culture.

López' main thesis, (citing Richard Stallman), was that technologies develop
as social processes and are shaped by cultural values. In this way, the
general principles of the Cuban revolution can be seen to be in harmony with
those of free software. The further adoption and use of free software,
according to López, is leading to more democratic access to knowledge and
opportunity, not just in Cuba, but globally. This opening talk was
enthusiastically received and set a positive tone for the rest of the day.  
  
Once the conference broke into three tracks, I attended a talk by `Jacob
Appelbaum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Appelbaumof>`_ on the `TOR
network <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ and the importance of anonymity.
Appelbaum explained the ways in which the TOR network was designed to ensure
four types of freedom: it's decentralized, encrypted, distributed, and unlike
other internet networks, meta-data free (i.e., it does not collect or
aggregate meta-data).

Additional talks occurring on day one shared speakers' experiences using open
source for projects such as collaborative mapping and creating an online
payment system, as well as more theoretical topics such as web development and
encryption. Former PSF Director, David Mertz, gave a talk on teaching Python
to Data Scientists, a topic that he will reprise in Portland at PyCon's
education summit at the end of this month. Talks were given in either English
or Spanish, with simultaneous translation provided by one of several bilingual
volunteers.

Another talk worth singling out was a provocative talk by ` Heather
Marsh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Marsh>`_ on the illusory nature of
the power that users assume to derive from the internet. According to Marsh,
such internet features as "thought bubbles" and "noise" pose obstacles to
collaboration and to challenging the "Ponzi schemes of power." These ideas are
more fully presented in Marsh's book, `Binding
Chaos <http://www.amazon.com/Binding-Chaos-collaboration-global-
scale/dp/1489527680>`_.

At the end of the day, a tired, but excited crowd posed for a group photo
before walking down the block to the conference dinner of Cuban food, mojitos,
and beer.  (And by the way, beer costs about $1 per can/bottle--I almost
didn't come home.)
