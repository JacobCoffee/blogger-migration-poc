Happy Holidays and Thank You!
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/12/happy-holidays-and-thank-you.html>`_.

Happy Holidays from the Python Software Foundation!

  

The holiday season gets us thinking about all that we have accomplished over
the past year and about those we are grateful for. This year we have kept the
mission of the PSF alive by planning conferences, promoted diversity outreach,
organizing workshops, and granting community service awards. We look forward
to keeping it going in the year ahead!

  

The PSF would not be what it is today without the help of our generous
sponsors. The PSF is the non-profit legal entity that holds and protects the
intellectual property rights behind Python, keeping it free and open for all
to use. Our sponsors' financial support aids in the PSFâ€™s mission to promote,
protect, and advance the Python programming language. In addition to enabling
the PSF to organize events and award grants, it allows key Python developers
to focus their energy on Python development rather than on legal matters. And,
donations are tax-deductible for organizations that pay taxes in the United
States!

  

Thank you to our newest sponsors in 2016!
