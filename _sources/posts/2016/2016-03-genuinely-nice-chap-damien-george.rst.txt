"A Genuinely Nice Chap": Community Service Award Recipient Damien George
========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/03/genuinely-nice-chap-damien-george.html>`_.

"We wouldn't have Python on the micro:bit if he hadn't made it work, to put it
simply," Nicholas Tollervey says. He's talking about Damien George, the
physicist and engineer behind `MicroPython <http://micropython.org/>`_, the
Python interpreter for microcontrollers.  
  
George began his project to build a Python interpreter for microcontrollers in
2013. "I started writing MicroPython to see if it's possible," he says. "Could
I shrink Python down small enough to run on these tiny chips?" From scratch,
he made a Python compiler so skinny it could squeeze into 128 kilobytes of
RAM, and then wrote the runtime and built-in functions. "After about 6 months
I realized it was possible, and I had a proof of concept."

Surprisingly, MicroPython is based not on the CPython code, but on the
documentation. "I tried to look as little as possible at CPython's
implementation," he says. "I'd say 95% of the Python language is specified in
the docs, maybe even more."  
  
George launched the `MicroPython campaign on
Kickstarter <https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/214379695/micro-python-
python-for-microcontrollers/>`_ at the end of 2013, and raised nearly Â£100,000.
With the support of donors and the efforts of volunteers, he released
MicroPython along with a small computer, the
`PyBoard <https://micropython.org/store/>`_, which packs a processor, RAM, LEDs,
and an accelerometer into a package less than two inches square.

The MicroPython PyBoard  
The BBC, meanwhile, wanted to port Python to its own little computer, the
`micro:bit <https://www.microbit.co.uk/>`_. They partnered with the Python
Software Foundation and worked with Tollervey, a PSF fellow, to obtain a
Python interpreter for their secret project. That effort fell through in April
2015, leaving Tollervey anxious that Python would be left out of the micro:bit
launch. Young coders can program the micro:bit with another tool, Microsoft's
TouchDevelop, but Tollervey says that Python on the micro:bit provides a
special opportunity: "The important thing about Python is continuity. Kids can
pick up Python because it's easy to learn, and it's also the same language you
use at the workplace. These are skills they can use in the future."  
  
By chance, in `a discussion over tea with an engineer from
ARM <http://ntoll.org/article/story-micropython-on-microbit>`_, Tollervey
realized MicroPython might work on the micro:bit. He sent a prototype of the
board to George with a note stuck to it: "I want this back, Damien," and a
smiley face. Within a week of getting the prototype, George had MicroPython
running on it. Tollervey says, "When we had that I knew we were on to a goer."
He did eventually get his board back.  
  
The Python Software Foundation `awarded Damien George a Community Service
Award in 2016 <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-
awards/#march-2016>`_. In addition to his extensive volunteer work on the BBC
micro:bit and MicroPython, George spent time answering questions, helping
users, and reviewing code from the wider MicroPython and micro:bit
communities. Tollervey adds, "He's a very good mentor, and just a genuinely
nice chap."  
  
Now that the micro:bit is launched, MicroPython is gaining a far wider
audience. Last Tuesday `the BBC began delivering micro:bits to a million
school children <http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-31834927>`_. George says,
"It's a relief that it's finally out there, and very exciting to see this new
era of kids using Python on these little devices."
