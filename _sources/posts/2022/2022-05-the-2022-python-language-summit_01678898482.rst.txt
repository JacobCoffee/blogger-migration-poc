The 2022 Python Language Summit
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit_01678898482.html>`_.

Every year, just before the start of PyCon US, around 30 core developers,
triagers, and special guests gather for the Python Language Summit: an all-day
event of talks where the future direction of Python is discussed. The summit
in 2022 was the first in-person summit since 2019, due to disruption caused by
the coronavirus pandemic in 2020-21.

This year's summit was covered by Alex Waygood.
