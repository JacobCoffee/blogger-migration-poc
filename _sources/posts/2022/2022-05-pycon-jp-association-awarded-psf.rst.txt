We interviewed Jonas Obrist on behalf of the PyCon JP Association to learn
more about their inspiration, their work with the Python community, and
supporting the Python Software Foundation - PSF. `Débora
Azevedo <https://twitter.com/pydebb>`_ also contributed to this article, by
sharing more light on the PyCon JP Association's efforts and commitment to the
Python community.

Jonas Obrist Speaks on the motivation behind the PyCon JP Association
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*What inspired the PyCon JP Association team into raising funds to support
the PSF?*

*  
*

We were inspired to raise funds after reading an announcement by the PSF
about`the impact of the pandemic on the foundation and PyCon
US <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-python-software-foundation-re-
opens.html>`_. We could of course empathize with the struggle given that we have
a similar situation, even if on a much smaller scale.

  

We tried to think of a good way to help and either
`Manabu <https://twitter.com/terapyon>`_ or
`Takanori <https://twitter.com/takanory>`_ came up with the idea to host online
events with presentations by members of the community with all proceeds going
to the PSF. We held two such events so far with over a hundred attendees and
even managed to gather some companies and individuals as sponsors.

  

Thanks to the online nature, costs were kept very low and we were able to make
a sizeable donation to the PSF, hopefully softening the financial blow of the
pandemic a bit.

  

*How do you think other Python communities can support the PSF?*

  

I think other communities have various ways to support the PSF depending on
each community's situation.

  

We have the fortune to be well established with great support from the wider
community and especially local companies, so we were able to make a `direct
financial contribution <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/>`_.

  

Not all communities are this fortunate, but I think there are still other ways
to contribute.

  

One such way is simply to boost awareness of the Python programming language
in the local developer community. ideally, this would eventually lead to
companies adopting Python more widely, which in turn could lead to `direct
support to the
PSF <https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=37>`_, either
via direct donations or support of `PyCon
US <https://us.pycon.org/2022/about/what-is-pycon/>`_ by these companies.

  

Boosting local communities also leads to more Python developers in general,
leading to a broader pool of people who could support the PSF in various ways.

  

The most important thing is for each community to think about what they can
do, even if it is just a small thing, given that we owe so much to the PSF.

  

Débora Azevedo speaks about the impact and significance of the PyCon JP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Association

One of the things I am most excited about is seeing the PyCon JP Association
team receiving this CSA and realizing that the work being done outside the US-
Europe countries is acknowledged.

  

PyCon JP association has risen to the financial challenge that the PSF went
through due to the pandemic and has organized `PyCon JP Charity
Talks <https://pyconjp.connpass.com/event/218154/>`_. Aiming to increase
awareness within the industry about the importance of the PSF is so
meaningful. The charity talks were initiatives by the PyCon JP association,
and it was a significant effort on their part. Their work is such an
outstanding work that shouldn't be overlooked.

  

As part of the wider Python community, it warms my heart to see that there are
many amazing people worldwide working so we can have a more sustainable Python
community.

  

Seeing local communities contributing to the global community, especially
regarding this financial aspect, shows that the community feels the need to
have different types of work done and understands the importance and impact of
each one of them.

  

And, as part of the Diversity and Inclusion workgroup and understanding the
impact of seeing people from non-US-based communities being acknowledged for
doing the work, it feels like we are being heard.

  

The PyCon JP association's community work is outstanding and I am so grateful
to them and for being in a community that values each contribution to its
development and growth.

  

The Python Software Foundation congratulates and celebrates the PyCon JP
association team -  `Manabu Terada <https://twitter.com/terapyon>`_, `Takanori
