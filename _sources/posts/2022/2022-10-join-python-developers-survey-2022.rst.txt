Join the Python Developers Survey 2022: Share and learn about the community
===========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/10/join-python-developers-survey-2022.html>`_.

This year we are conducting the sixth iteration of the official Python
Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language
and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, we can
identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community
and the key insights into it. We encourage you to contribute to our
community’s knowledge. The survey should only take you about 10-15 minutes to
complete.

2022! <https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c1-python-developers-survey-2022>`_

The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation
and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated
results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in
its entirety), who will each receive a $100 Amazon Gift Card or a local
equivalent.
