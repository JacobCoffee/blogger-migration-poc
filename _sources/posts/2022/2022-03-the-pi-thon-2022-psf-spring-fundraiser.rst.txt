The Pi-thon 2022 PSF Spring Fundraiser!
=======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/03/the-pi-thon-2022-psf-spring-fundraiser.html>`_.

Happy Pi Day, ùõëthonistas! 2022 has been a year with some special dates, and we
wanted to honor one more. We are feeling celebratory and excited here at the
PSF, having made it through 2020 and 2021 by the strength of our community. We
confronted obstacles, comforted each other, found successes, and created fun
together. So we are kicking off our Spring Fundraiser on a light and nerdy
note, by celebrating our favorite Greek letter and mathematical constant.

`Donate to the PSF
today <https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=37>`_, in
whatever multiple of pi you choose, and you will receive one-of-a-kind digital
ùõëSF swag as a thank you!

Contributing to the PSF is a great way to show your love for Python. Your
donation allows the PSF to continue to host `PyCon US <http://us.pycon.org>`_
and provide scholarships, tutorials, sprints, and more; to send
`grants <https://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_ to Python events and projects
around the world; to `support <https://www.python.org/psf/fiscal-sponsorees/>`_
great Python projects and events like `PyLadies <https://pyladies.com/>`_ and
`PyCascades <https://2022.pycascades.com/>`_; to host and maintain`
PyPI.org <http://pypi.org>`_; and to support the advancement of the Python
language. Your gifts help keep the PSF stable and sustainable, so we can
support the Python ecosystem to thrive in the long term.

Some highlights of what the PSF has been able to do with our community in the
last year:

  * We celebrated Python‚Äôs 30th and the PSF‚Äôs 20th Anniversary!
  * Over 2500 Pythonistas came together to make our virtual `PyCon US 2021 <https://us.pycon.org/2021/highlights/>`_ a huge success.
  * We sent grants to 129 groups in 41 countries (on every continent except Antarctica!) to hold virtual events and connect.
  * We supported 13 Python community groups and projects as fiscal sponsorees.
  * We hosted PyPI.org for millions of users.
  * .We brought on Shamika Mohanan as Packaging Project Manager, to work on `the future of PyPI <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/12/pypi-user-feedback-summary.html>`_. 
  * `≈Åukasz Langa <https://lukasz.langa.pl/a072a74b-19d7-41ff-a294-e6b1319fdb6e/>`_ became the PSF‚Äôs inaugural Developer in Residence to establish a full-time core developer role.

Show your love for our Python community and contribute to the Spring
Fundraiser by May 3rd to get your slice of the pi! We aren‚Äôt setting a
specific target this year, because honestly it‚Äôs been really hard to predict
what will be possible for people in general‚Äîwe aren‚Äôt going to pretend
anything is easy to forecast right now! But we‚Äôd love for as many of you to
participate as you can and bring us all a little extra hap-pi-ness.

Like ùõë, our appreciation for the Python community and your support can only be
expressed as an approximation‚Äîit is greater than words can say. And like our
gratitude, ùõë‚Äôs digits are infinite. We are sincerely thankful for every single
contribution: We couldn‚Äôt do this without you, and we feel very lucky to share
a community with you.

We are wishing you all a very happy Pi Day!
