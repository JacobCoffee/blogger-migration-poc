Where is the PSF?
=================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/11/where-is-psf.html>`_.

Where to Find the PSF Online  
------------------------------

One of the main ways we reach people for news and information about the PSF
and Python is Twitter. There’s been a lot of uncertainty around that platform
recently, so we wanted to share a brief round up of other places you can find
us:  

  * *Read our blog* : It’s here! You found it! You can always find our latest updates here at `pyfound.blogspot.com <http://pyfound.blogspot.com>`_.
  * *Subscribe to our newsletter* : We send out an email newsletter about every other month.  You can sign up here: <https://www.python.org/psf/newsletter/>  

  * *Follow us on LinkedIn* : <https://www.linkedin.com/company/python-software-foundation>
  * *Follow us on Mastodon* : <https://fosstodon.org/@thepsf>
  * *We're still on Twitter:*<https://twitter.com/ThePSF>   

As always, if you are looking for technical support rather than news about the
foundation, we have collected links and resources here for people who are new
or looking to get deeper into the Python programming language:

discuss.python.org <https://discuss.python.org/>`_
