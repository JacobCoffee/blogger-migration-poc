No Starch Press has released an all-Python Humble Bundle!
=========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/no-starch-press-has-released-all-python.html>`_.

`No Starch Press <https://nostarch.com/>`_, an indie tech-book publisher and
Community sponsor of the PSF,  just announced a partnership with Humble Bundle
that lets you pay what you want for all-Python DRM-free ebook titles for
Python beginners to pros. And a share of the proceeds from the bundle goes to
the PSF!

The “`Python, by No Starch Press <https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-
no-starch-press-books>`_” bundle runs now through May 23rd and benefits the PSF
as well as Hacker Initiative, a public 501(c)(3) organization for hackers,
created by NSP founder Bill Pollock.  

The bundle includes picks for all levels like _Python Crash Course_ (Eric
Matthes), _Automate the Boring Stuff with Python_ (Al Sweigart), and _Doing
Math with Python_(Amit Saha). The promotion has a pay-what-you-want model, so
you can choose a pricing tier for up to 18 ebooks, then decide how much of
your purchase goes to the featured causes.

Pricing starts at $1 for _Python Playground_ (Mahesh Venkitachalam) + _Doing
Math with Python_ , or starting at $30 you can get all 18 Python ebooks!

`Check it out <https://www.humblebundle.com/books/python-no-starch-press-
