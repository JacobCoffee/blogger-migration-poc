2021 was a challenging and exciting year for the PSF. We’ve done our best to
capture some of the key numbers, details, and context in `our latest annual
report <https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2021/>`_. Some highlights of
what you’ll find in the annual report include:

  * Letter from our outgoing Board Chair Lorena Mesa
  * Personal reflection on the PSF’s 20th anniversary from our outgoing interim general manager and longtime community member Thomas Wouters
  * Note from our new Executive Director Deb Nicholson
  * Account by Łukasz Langa on what he’s accomplished and learned in his first year as the inaugural PSF Developer in Residence
  * PyCon US 2021 by the numbers   

  * Where we sent grant funding in 2021
  * Summary of our 2021 financials
  * Great photos plus testimonials from some of the small number of live events the PSF supported in 2021, generously shared by these groups who are doing great work for the Python community around the world:
