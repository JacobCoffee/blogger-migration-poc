Python Developers Survey 2021: Python is everywhere
===================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/06/python-developers-survey-2021-python-is.html>`_.

We are excited to announce the results of the fifth official annual Python
Developers Survey. This work is done each year as a collaborative effort
between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. Late last year, more
than 23,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200
countries/regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of
the language and the ecosystem around it.  
  
Python is being used by the vast majority (84%) of survey respondents as their
primary language and by many others as just one more tool in their box.
Interestingly, only 29% of the Python developers involved in data analysis and
machine learning consider themselves to be Data Scientists. And like past
years, many use Python in conjunction with other popular development and data
tools like SQL, Jupyter Notebook, Virtualenv, Docker or with the most popular
web development technologies including Django, Javascript and HTML.

This is also the first time we have packaging information in the survey. It
was interesting to see the wide range of tools that Python users are employing
for their packaging tasks. The PSF is currently focusing on improving the
packaging ecosystem and building a roadmap for the future of packaging. We
hope you will continue sharing your opinions with us on this part of your work
so that we can continue improving.

If you do look at the raw data and discover things you think the community
would be interested in, we hope youâ€™ll let us know. Please share your thoughts
on Twitter or other social media, mentioning

`@ThePSF <https://twitter.com/ThePSF>`_ with the #pythondevsurvey hashtag. We
are also open to any suggestions and feedback related to this survey which
could help us run an even better one next time. You are also encouraged to
open issues `here <https://github.com/python/python-dev-survey/issues>`_ or join
the conversation on `our forum <http://discuss.python.org/>`_.
