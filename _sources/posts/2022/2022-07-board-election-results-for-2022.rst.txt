Board Election Results for 2022!
================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/07/board-election-results-for-2022.html>`_.

Congratulations to everyone who won a seat on the PSF Board! We’re so excited
to work with you. New and returning Board Directors will start their three
year terms this month at the next PSF board meeting. Thanks to everyone else
who ran this year and added their voice to the conversation about the future
of the Python community. It was a tough race with many amazing candidates.

Thanks to everyone who voted and helped us spread the word! We really
appreciate that so many of you took the time to participate in our elections
this year. By the numbers, we sent ballots to 1,459 voting PSF members who
then chose among 26 nominees. By the end 578 votes were cast, well over the
one third required for quorum.  
  
While the board elections are over, there are lots of other ways to get
involved with the Python community. Here are `a few
things <https://www.python.org/psf/get-involved/>`_ you can get started with or
you could consider serving with one of our `working
groups <https://www.python.org/psf/committees/>`_. If you want to start
participating on the technical side of things, you might want to `check out
our forum <https://discuss.python.org/>`_. Next year’s board elections will
happen at approximately the same time in 2023. If you want to make sure you
are notified via email, join the `psf-
vote <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/psf-vote>`_ mailing list.
