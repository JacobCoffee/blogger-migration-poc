To the Egoless Pythonistas That Makes Space at the Table: A. Jesse Jiryu Davis, Community Service Award Q4 2017 Recipient
=========================================================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/05/to-egoless-pythonistas-that-makes-space.html>`_.

When we think of Pythonistas that have made a significant mark in the Python
community there are many to consider - Python open source project maintainers,
the Python core developers, or the countless Python organizers who bring
Python events to new corners of the world. All these Pythonistas demonstrate
the dedication and commitment it requires to make Python and the Python
community work. Yet there are many whose contributions are at times less
apparent, less visible. These Pythonistas are not so much hidden as
intentionally working behind the scenes, offering assistance to others, so
that they can take the mantle of leadership and make their own mark in the
community. In more ways than one, A. Jesse Jiryu Davis has been a mentor and
advocate for the community, inspiring many to take that next step in their own
Python pursuits. It is for this reason that the Python Software Foundation
recognizes `A. Jesse Jiryu Davis <https://twitter.com/jessejiryudavis?lang=en>`_
with a `Q4 2017 Community Service
Award <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#december-2017>`_:

> RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the Q4 2017 Community
> Service Award to A. Jesse Jiryu Davis for the work he does on the PSF blog,
> his outreach & education efforts, and for organizing PyGotham 2017.

Coders aren’t good communicators … right?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our paths into Python are varied, yet there are common themes that bring us to
Python. Perhaps your workplace uses Python or perhaps Python was the obvious
language to use to solve the problem you were confronted with. For others,
though, we arrive at Python because of the rich documentation and friendly
community. In his day to day Jesse is a staff engineer at
`MongoDB <https://www.mongodb.com/>`_. As such, Jesse has written tools for
MongoDB like `Motor <http://motor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, the async
MongoDB Python driver.  In his role Jesse explains, “I’m really lucky, I was
hired by an open source software company who encouraged me to become a well
known member of Python community by writing and speaking”. Contributing to and
maintaining open source also means contributing to the documentation
surrounding open source tools. While writing on the tools that Jesse helped
create was an entry point into writing, Jesse recognized the unique position
he had within his role, “I want[ed] to use this advantage to open up these
opportunities to other folks”.

Jesse actively writes on his `personal blog <https://emptysqua.re/blog/>`_ on
such topics as Python (and more broadly programming), photography, and zen as
well as on several other
`platforms <https://opensource.com/article/18/3/avoid-humiliating-newcomers>`_.
In his Python content Jesse has written on advanced concepts like Python’s
`Global Interpreter Lock <https://emptysqua.re/blog/grok-the-gil-fast-thread-
safe-python/>`_ to content accessible to programmers of any level like `how to
begin one’s public speaking career <https://emptysqua.re/blog/public-speaking-
workshops-february-2018/>`_. Crafting accessible and open content has been a way
that Jesse has be able to channel his position into learning opportunities for
others (for example, see Jesse’s PyCon 2016 talk “`Write an Excellent
Programming Blog <http://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2016/a-jesse-jiryu-davis-write-
an-excellent-programming-blog-pycon-2016.html>`_”).

Another location Jesse actively writes in on the Python Software Foundation
`blog <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/>`_. Part of formerly a team of three
bloggers, Jesse has been a blogger for the PSF since early 2016. Often the
work on the PSF blog requires individuals to do extensive research and
interviews on Pythonistas and communicate critical Python
`news <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/01/time-to-upgrade-your-python-
tls-v12.html>`_. On-boarding individuals requires a careful attention to detail
and countless hours of review and back and forth as all the work happens
remotely in a decentralized fashion. PSF blogger Christy Heaton joined the
Python Software Foundation blogging team in late 2016, “I have considered
Jesse a mentor since I began blogging for the PSF. When I got my first
assignment, and wasn't sure where to start,” she recalls. “Jesse took the time
to thoughtfully detail his process for me, in an ego-less and judgement-free
way. Now the process is so natural, and I have Jesse to thank for that!”

Sharing the Wealth: Empowering Others to Speak and Share in the Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Community

Jesse’s writing isn’t the only mechanism he’s used to empower others.  One of
the open questions Jesse was interested in exploring as a PyGotham 2017
organizer included the question of how to reach more underrepresented folks to
submit and speak at PyGotham. Part of this exploration included participating
in a PyLadies NYC panel to discuss the CFP process, discuss example
submissions, and learn more about what challenges confronting individuals when
submitting talks.

The event inspired Jesse to spearhead a unique opportunity for PyGotham --
discover a way for new speakers to have access to professional speaker
coaching. “Speaking and writing are side gigs for programmers. We are expected
to be good at them, if we are then that’s beneficial for our careers. Often,
though, we don’t know what we are doing. There are many writers and speakers
outside tech that are highly skilled and underpaid, and we are often overpaid
so there is an opportunity to share this wealth,” Jesse explains. Jesse’s own
speaking coach, `Melissa Collom <http://melissacollom.com/>`_, is a professional
opera singer and Jesse attributes much of his own success in becoming a
storyteller, as she has helped him learn how to use his voice and body
effectively to make him a compelling speaker. Melissa comments that the “same
things that make me an effective performer are the same things that make
someone an effective communicator". Therefore when it comes to public speaking
Melissa believes that there is a “plurality of excellences, finding the most
authentic expression of you means finding what works best for you".

Based upon this belief that there are complementary skill sets in the world
and that it’s often by working together that we as individuals can find our
“plurality of excellence”, Jesse set about fundraising to ensure that there
would be an ability for `11 new PyGotham speakers to have access to a speaking
coach <https://emptysqua.re/blog/coaching-for-first-time-pygotham-speakers/>`_.
“The thing that stands out to me [about Jesse is he] believes in mentorship
and he is a feminist. Jesse believes that women and non-binary people [should]
have a place at the table. He is willing to leverage his privilege to help
pull some extra chairs up to the table,” Melissa says when describing Jesse.

Additionally Jesse has worked outside of the conference space to help others
in developing their pubic speaking careers. “I appreciate Jesse as an educator
and mentor in the Python world. His conference talks are educational,
engaging, and thought-provoking. Jesse enjoys sharing his knowledge with
others and paying it forward. He is a true ally,” former Python Software
Foundation Director and PyLadies Remote Organizer `Anna
Ossowski <https://twitter.com/OssAnna16>`_ shares. In February 2018 as a part of
the `Global Diversity CFP Day <https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/>`_
PyLadies Remote invited Jesse to share his expertise in and personal journey
into public speaking and writing.  “I am thankful for Jesse taking the time to
teach PyLadies Remote classes for us, as well as for his help with my talk
proposals,” Anna concludes.

We All Have Something to Contribute: What will you contribute?

The theme that emerges time after time when speaking with those that have
worked with Jesse is his selflessness and desire to leave more behind than he
may take. Director of Python Software Foundation Operations Ewa Jodlowska
shares, “I’ve known of Jesse for many years due to his contributions to the
Python community. What stands out the most is the willingness to help others.”
From his writing, to his speaking, to his mentoring, to his open source
projects (`that begs us to question our privilege and social
location <https://www.proporti.onl/>`_), to his relentless advocacy Jesse
demonstrates the richness of the Python community in our shared values of
contributing often and freely sharing. That said, we all have something to
contribute to the Python community, what will your contribution be?
