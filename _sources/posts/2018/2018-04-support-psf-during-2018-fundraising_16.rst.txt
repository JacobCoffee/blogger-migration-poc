Support the PSF during the 2018 Fundraising Drive
=================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/04/support-psf-during-2018-fundraising_16.html>`_.

The PSF is launching an exciting fundraising drive with a goal of raising
$20,000.00 USD by May 12th.  *The drive begins April 16, 2018 and concludes
at PyCon on May 12th*.  
  
Your donations help the Python community worldwide by supporting sprints,
meetups, community events and projects, the Python Ambassador Program, fiscal
sponsorships, and of course, software development and open source projects.
All of these initiatives help improve the Python community and Python tools
that you use daily. The work cannot be done without the generous financial
support that individuals and organizations provide us.  
  
It is easy to donate - simply click on the amount you would like to give, and
enter your email address. Confirm your contribution and you will be able to
pay with your PayPal account or a credit or debit card. Contributions are tax
deductible for individuals and organizations in the United States.  
  
*To thank you for your financial support, we will enter you in a drawing to
win the following prizes:*  
  

  * Ticket to PyCon 2019 (1 winner)
  * Photos with Guido van Rossum at PyCon 2018 (must be present to win)
  * Lunch with Guido van Rossum at PyCon 2018 (8 winners, must be present to win)
  * Custom designed Guido T-Shirt (5 winners)
  * “I Donated” stickers
  * Custom designed “Guido” stickers

  
More details on contributing can be found on the `2018 Q2 Fundraising
Drive <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2018-q2-drive/>`_ page. _No donation
is necessary to enter the drawing._  
  
*We at the PSF want to thank you for all that you do. Your support is what
makes the PSF possible and is greatly appreciated by the Python community.*
