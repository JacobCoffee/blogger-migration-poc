2018 PSF Recurring Giving Campaign
==================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/10/2018-psf-recurring-giving-campaign.html>`_.

The PSF is launching an end-of-year fundraising drive to build a sustainable
community of supporters. Our goal is to raise $30,000! You can help by signing
up to give monthly or if you’re already a supporting member (Thank You!!), by
checking the box to renew your membership automatically.  
  
The drive begins October 22 and concludes November 21, 2018.  
  
*_Your donations have IMPACT_*  
  
Over $118,543 was awarded in financial aid to 143 PyCon attendees in 2018.  
$240,000 has been paid in grants from January through September 2018 to
recipients in 45 different countries.  
  
Some examples of how your donation dollars are spent:  
  

  * $35,000 was provided to the Python Core Development Sprint in 2018
  * $20,000 helps support 11 Python conferences, impacting over  3,000 people globally
  * $20,000 helps support ~25 hands-on workshops impacting over 700 people 
  * $10,000 supports user group meetup fees for 150 groups for 6 months
  * $5,000 provides hosting for 3-4 PSF community web services for a year(e.g. Mail.python.org, uspycon.org, wiki.python.org)
  * $1,000 helps supports 2 regional conferences, impacting over 500 people
  * $50 supports a Python meetup group for 3 months

  
This work can’t be done without the generous financial support that people
like you provide.
