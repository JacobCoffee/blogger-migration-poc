PyCon 2019 - Call for Sponsors
==============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/08/pycon-2019-call-for-sponsors.html>`_.

It seems like `PyCon 2018 <https://us.pycon.org/2018>`_ was just last week, but
the 2019 edition will be here before we know it. We want to say thanks to all
our sponsors who helped make the conference a huge success. This year, we
welcomed 3,260 attendees from 48 different countries around the world,
strengthening the connection in our beloved community even more.

The invaluable and generous support of our PyCon sponsors enables the Python
Software Foundation to help and improve the Python community worldwide by
promoting sprints, meetups, events, projects, fiscal sponsorships, software
development, open source projects and the Python Ambassador Program – which
helps the creation of communities where Python is not well known.

PyCon sponsorship enabled us to award $118,543 USD in financial aid to 143
attendees in 2018. It also generates 80% of the PSF's revenue, making
financial aid, conferences, workshops, and training support possible. As a
result, in 2017 $271,138 was awarded to grant recipients in 34 different
countries and we are on track to meet or beat our total from last year.

Your sponsorship helps keep PyCon affordable and accessible to the widest
possible audience.

Here is a sample of the many benefits from being a sponsor:

  * Being part of the biggest Python conference in the world
  * Visibility to those who could potentially become new customers or employees
  * Increasing your brand exposure and elevating your corporate identity within the community
  * Expose your products to more than 3,200 attendees
  * Enhance your company’s reputation by supporting and investing in Python and the open source community

Depending on your level of sponsorship, packages may include complimentary
conference passes, booth space, lead retrieval scanners, speaking
opportunities, and participation in the Job Fair. Our current sponsorship
prospectus can be found
`here <https://us.pycon.org/2019/sponsors/prospectus/>`_. Sponsors in the
Diamond, Platinum, Gold or Silver categories will receive additional tickets
to the conference.

We want to hear from you! Contact us anytime - we are flexible and willing to
build a sponsorship package that fits your needs. Only you know your business,
how you measure success and what you're looking for. For more information
please contact `betsy@python.org <mailto:betsy@python.org>`_ or `pycon-
sponsors@python.org <mailto:pycon-sponsors@python.org>`_.

We proudly want to announce the organizations that are already sponsoring the

Here’s what our attendees say about the PyCon US experience:
------------------------------------------------------------

> #PyCon2018 was my first PyCon. I have had an INCREDIBLE time! I've listened
> to inspirational speakers; met some of the most amazing people and have made
> lifelong connections. Most of all, I had FUN! Thanks to the brilliant @pycon
> team for working tirelessly to make it a reality!

\- Julian Sequeira (@_juliansequeira)

  

PyCon has been my gold standard for conference accessibility as long as I've
been attending, they do a great job and the community here really reflects it.
I appreciate all your hard work @pycon, keep it up.

\- Jonan Scheffler (@thejonanshow)  

> #pycon2018 was incredible. The support and hospitality from #Cleveland was
> stellar. Lighting all the downtown buildings in blue and yellow was a class
> act. I can’t wait to come back next year for some Mabel’s BBQ and the
> amazing @pycon community

\- Jenn Basalone (@pennyblackio)  

> One of more understated benefits of @pycon is the economic and social impact
> in the surrounding communities it takes place at. In the case of larger
> cities, might not a big deal. In smaller locales, like Cleveland, that
> impact can be huge!

\- Ruben Orduz (@rdodev)  

> Just got back from @pycon. Was delighted by the inclusiveness and
> thoughtfulness I saw there.
