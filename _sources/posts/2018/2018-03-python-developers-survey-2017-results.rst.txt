Python Developers Survey 2017 Results: Learn about the community
================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/03/python-developers-survey-2017-results.html>`_.

At the end of 2017, the Python Software Foundation, together with JetBrains,
conducted an official *Python Developers Survey*. We set out to identify the
latest trends and gather insight into how the Python development world looks
today. *Over 9,500 developers from almost 150 countries* participated to
help us map out an accurate landscape of the Python community. We are super
excited to share the results of the survey with you!*

We hope the survey findings will help us better understand the current state
of the Python developer community and answer some potential questions.
Included in the survey results is information about the most popular types of
Python development, trending frameworks, libraries and tools, additional
languages used together with Python, adoption rates of different Python
versions, and gain many other insights into the world of Python.  
  
We couldn’t include all the potential findings in the report. Therefore If you
have specific unanswered questions please send them to us and we’ll dig into
the data for an answer. Or if you want to delve into the data yourself, we’re
also sharing the `raw survey data <http://tbd/>`_, which anyone can use to
arrive at their own conclusions and generate additional findings.  
  
If you do go the extra step and dive into the survey data, we’d be interested
to learn about your findings! Please share them on Twitter or on other social
media by tagging `@jetbrains <https://twitter.com/jetbrains>`_‏ and
`@ThePSF <https://twitter.com/ThePSF>`_ with the hashtag #pythondevsurvey2017.
We’re also open to any suggestions and feedback related to the survey so we
can run an even better one next time.  
  
Huge thanks to all the participants of the survey and to the amazing team at
PSF and JetBrains that worked hard to make this happen!
