Cleveland, the Rock and Roll Capital of the World: Getting to Know Our PyCon 2018 Host City
===========================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/05/cleveland-rock-and-roll-capital-of.html>`_.

For those of you coming to PyCon 2018, we have collated some references to
places to eat, grab a beverage of choice, explore, stay, or even play. Before
we begin covering the city, if this is your first PyCon, you might want to
take some time to read Trey Hunner's `suggestions on how to Make the Most of
Your First PyCon <http://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-
first-pycon/>`_. If you are a music fan, the `Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame <https://www.rockhall.com/>`_ will likely be a place you want to visit. In
addition you can catch a show and have dinner at the `House of Blues -
Cleveland <http://www.houseofblues.com/cleveland>`_. The `Cleveland
Orchestra <https://www.clevelandorchestra.com/>`_ will be performing works by
Beethoven during the PyCon weekends. Like most large cities, Cleveland has an
`Art Museum <http://www.clevelandart.org/>`_ and a `Science
Center <http://greatscience.com/>`_. Fans of the movie “A Christmas Story” might
be excited to hear that the `house used in the film (outside
shots) <http://www.achristmasstoryhouse.com/>`_ is located in the section of
Cleveland called Tremont. You can visit and tour the house and museum seven
days a week, 10am to 5pm. You will surely be hungry and thirsty during PyCon.
Cleveland has an establishment to satisfy just about any craving you might
have. There are many dining options within walking distance of the `Huntington
Cleveland Convention Center <http://www.clevelandconventions.com/>`_, especially
around the `East 4th street <http://www.east4thstreet.com/>`_ area. Fellow
Pythonista and PyOhio 2018-19 Chair `Dave Forgac has a food and drink
compilation <https://daveops.com/posts/guide-to-cleveland-food-and-drink/>`_
that covers areas both inside and outside of Downtown Cleveland. In addition,
the PyCon team has compiled a `listing on the PyCon recommendations
page <https://us.pycon.org/2018/venue/recommendations/>`_. While Python and the
Python Community are our reasons for gathering in Cleveland next week, there
are many other events occurring that may be of interest. Since the whole of
PyCon 2018 spans nine days, there are plenty of opportunities to enjoy other
pursuits, like those compiled by the PyCon team
`here <https://us.pycon.org/2018/venue/cle_events/>`_. Dave Forgac also has a
`quick guide to the essentials of Cleveland <https://daveops.com/posts/guide-
to-cleveland-essentials/>`_. Of course, getting around Cleveland is like most
other towns, so the PyCon team has you covered with a `list of options for
transit <https://us.pycon.org/2018/venue/transit/>`_. _We hope to see you at
PyCon in Cleveland, Ohio this year and look forward to celebrating the Python
Community with you all._
