2018 Python Software Foundation Board Election: What is it and how can I learn more?
====================================================================================

Every year the Python Software Foundation announces an open call for
nominations for the PSF Board. Following the 2017 PSF members vote, only a
subset of the entire board’s seats are open. This year there are four seats
available - three (3) seats each with a three year term and one (1) seat that
will finish the last two years of a three year term. Nominations for the board
are open through May 25th, 2018 23:59:59

someone else?

Anyone can run for a board member, as outlined by the PSF bylaws (reference

After nominations close, voting will begin on June 1st, 2018. If you wish to
