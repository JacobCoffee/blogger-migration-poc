PyPI Security and Accessibility Q1 2019 Request for Proposals Update
====================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/12/pypi-security-and-accessibility-q1-2019.html>`_.

Earlier this year we `launched a Request for
Information <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/10/pypi-security-and-
accessibility-q1-2019.html>`_ (RFI) followed by the `launch of a Request for
Proposals <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/11/pypi-security-and-
accessibility-q1-2019.html>`_ (RFP) in November to fulfill a contract for the
`Open Technology Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/>`_ (OTF) `Core Infrastructure
Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/funds/core-infrastructure-fund/>`_.  

  
The initial deadline for our RFP was December 14th. We had hoped to begin work
with the selected proposers in January 2019, but ultimately fell short of the
ability to do so.  
  

What’s holding us back
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
After the deadline passed there were no proposals submitted for Milestone 2.
This leaves us in a position where the project cannot proceed as planned
without reassessing the RFP process and extending the deadline.  

How we’ll move forward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
The RFP document has been `updated <https://github.com/python/request-
for/commit/263aad69a25eaf74588bbb4e245c5037a5791410>`_ based on feedback
received from those who took part in the initial period to allow for
additional flexibility on proposal parameters.  
  
The `RFP <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/aaa24d92ea12c28ae4e9f8c17ef86770bfa78427/2019-Q1-PyPI/RFP.md>`_
contained two milestones that could be proposed for independently or as a
pair. In responses to our RFP the `security development
milestone <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/aaa24d92ea12c28ae4e9f8c17ef86770bfa78427/2019-Q1-PyPI/RFP.md#milestone-1
---security-development>`_ (Milestone 1) received more attention than the
`accessibility and internationalization
milestone <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/aaa24d92ea12c28ae4e9f8c17ef86770bfa78427/2019-Q1-PyPI/RFP.md#milestone-2
---accessibility-and-internationalization-development>`_ (Milestone 2).  
  
Given that we will at least need to extend the RFP period to obtain proposals
for Milestone 2, we plan to continue to accept proposals for both. This offers
us the best chance to select a proposal that will best utilize the available
funds.  
  
Our new deadline for responses will be the end of the day January 31st, 2019
`AoE <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe>`_. You can read the full
Request for Proposals document `here <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/master/2019-Q1-PyPI/RFP.md>`_.  
  
If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about the RFP please contact
the Python Software Foundation Director of Infrastructure, `Ernest W. Durbin
III <mailto:ernest@python.org>`_. Proposers may also discuss the RFP in our
community discussion forum at
`discuss.python.org <https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-
foundation/rfp-pypi-project-q1-2019>`_.
