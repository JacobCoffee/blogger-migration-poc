Welcome New PSF Members!
========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/05/welcome-new-psf-members.html>`_.

After the spring elections, the Foundation is happy to welcome a new group of
members.

All members of the PSF are nominated by an existing member for their work in
the Python community. We have quite a diverse set of community members joining
us this year, with representation across many countries and individuals
contributing to many areas of the Python world.

As with years past, a group of individuals known for their contributions of
code, either to Python implementations or other projects in the Python
ecosystem, were elected. We also have a number of members recognized for their
work with PyCon and other Python conferences around the world. Community
effort is another theme and we have several members known for their work
building and expanding their local Python communities as well as the global
community. Several folks who keep various Python infrastructure up and running
were also elected.

Please join us in welcoming all of the new members to the Foundation!
