PSF Moves to Require Code of Conduct for Conference Grants
==========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/12/psf-moves-to-require-code-of-conduct.html>`_.

*On Wednesday, November 21, the Python Software Foundation’s board of
directors voted on two`
resolutions <http://python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/>`_ on the topic of
Codes of Conduct at Python conferences. As the Python conference landscape
grows to include more events and attract more attendees, the Foundation looks
to ensure that conferences, new and old, are being run in a way that is
enjoyable for all.  
  
The first resolution passed by the board serves as the Foundation’s
recommendation that all Python conferences and related events create and apply
a Code of Conduct. The board unanimously agreed on this point, suggesting that
publicly documented expectations and plans of action are necessary when
planning and running an event in our community.  
  
The second resolution passed by the board serves as the Foundation’s
requirement that all Python conferences and related events create and apply a
Code of Conduct. Without a code in place, the Foundation will not fund the
event.  
  
`PyCon US <https://us.pycon.org/2013/>`_, the largest of the Python conferences,
first implemented a `Code of
Conduct <https://us.pycon.org/2012/codeofconduct/>`_ for the March 2012
conference. For PyCon 2013, `the code <https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-
of-conduct/>`_ was left the same, but comes with the addition of documented
`incident handling guidelines <https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-
conduct/harassment-incidents/>`_. Many conferences followed suit to add a code,
such as `PyOhio <http://pyohio.org/blog/2012/07/02/pycon-code-conduct-adopted-
pyohio/>`_, `pyArkansas <http://www.pyarkansas.org/about/conduct/>`_,
`PyTexas <http://www.pytexas.org/2012/about/conduct/>`_, `PyCon
Canada <http://2012.pycon.ca/conduct>`_, and others.  
  
PyCon’s Code of Conduct is structured after one created by `The Ada
Initiative <http://adainitiative.org/>`_ and others, available under the
