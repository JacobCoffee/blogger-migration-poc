PSF Grants Over $37,000 to the Python Community in 2011
=======================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/01/psf-grants-over-37000-to-python.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation provides financial support to many Python
related conferences and projects. In 2011, the grants and awards totaled
*US$37,511*. As we enter the new year, we want to take this opportunity to
review some of the work funded by, and for, the Python community throughout
the year.

Conferences
^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the most prominent ways the PSF supports the community is through the
conference assistance program. Organizers of Python-related conferences are
eligible to receive grants toward conference-related expenses, including
renting space, travel, catering, etc.

  * `PyCon AU <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/pycon-australia.html>`_ (Australia) was the first conference to be granted money in 2011 and received US$1500
  * `EuroPython <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/04/psf-grants-europython-us2000.html>`_ 2011 was given US$2000
  * `SciPy 2011 <http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2011-05-16/#id14>`_ received US$2000 for the conference held in Austin, TX
  * `Kiwi PyCon <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/04/kiwi-pycon-receives-us2000.html>`_ 2011 also received US$2000
  * `PyCon DE <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/08/pycon-de-2010-funding.html>`_ (Germany) was given US$1500
  * `PyArgentina <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/08/psf-grants-pyargentina-us1500.html>`_ received US$1500
  * `PyCon Ireland <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/09/psf-grants-pycon-ireland-us1500.html>`_ received US$1500
  * `PyCon PL <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/09/psf-grants-pycon-pl-2011.html>`_ (Poland) received US$750
  * `PyTexas <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/10/psf-granted-pytexas-2011-us750.html>`_ 2011 received US$750
  * `The GNOME Foundation <http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2011-05-16/#libre-graphics-meeting-lgm-funding>`_ for the 2011 Libre Graphics Meeting was given US$1500 in funds

Projects and Porting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This year the PSF gave grants to support several software and community
projects that provide significant benefit to Python users.

  * `Read the Docs <http://readthedocs.org>`_ received US$840 for `hosting fees <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/psf-funds-readthedocsorg.html>`_
  * The `Python Miro Community <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/funding-python-miro-community.html>`_ project received US$1800 to cover service fees and project expenses
  * The `PyPy <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/05/pypy-receives-us10000-at-pycon-usa.html>`_ Project was awarded US$10,000 at PyCon 2011
  * `Chris McDonough <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/09/psf-provides-grant-to-port-webob.html>`_ was granted US$3000 to port the WebOb project to Python 3
  * The PSF also gave US$2121 to 11 Python-related sprints

Outreach
^^^^^^^^

Besides funding projects from existing community members, the PSF has also
funded projects intended to introduce new people to Python and expand our
community.

  * `Vern Ceder <http://learnpython.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/iste-python-and-robots/>`_ was granted US$500 to `travel <http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2011-03-21/#id15>`_ to the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) for a speaking engagement
  * `PyLadies <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/06/pyladies-gets-psf-grant.html>`_ received US$1220
  * The `Boston Python Workshop <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/11/boston-python-workshop-psf-grant.html>`_ received a US$3300 grant to support and grow the workshop

Receiving Grants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several sources for funding through the PSF, depending on the nature
of your project.

  1. Conference organizers can contact the PSF Board directly (psf at python.org) with inquiries. Please keep in mind that it may take some time to approve and transfer the funds, so plan ahead and submit your request early.
  2. The `Python Sprints <http://pythonsprints.com/>`_ project provides modest grants for groups to host sprints on Python-related projects.
  3. A special fund is set aside for porting open source projects to Python 3. All you need to do is apply for assistance, and Jesse Noller will even `help <http://jessenoller.com/2011/12/09/porting-to-python-3-an-offer-for-you/>`_ you with your proposal! See the `Grant Guidelines <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_ for more information.
  4. Other projects seeking assistance should also email the board (psf at python.org) with a detailed request.

Donating to the PSF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Python Software Foundation `accepts
donations <http://www.python.org/psf/donations/>`_ through the web or via check
or wire transfer. For US taxpayers, contributions to the PSF are tax-
deductible.
