Indianapolis Python Workshop - April 13-14
==========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/04/indianapolis-python-workshop-april-13.html>`_.

If you're in the Indianapolis, Indiana area on April 13-14, join the locals
from `IndyPy <http://www.meetup.com/python-182/>`_ as well as the `Boston Python
Workshop <http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop>`_ and
`OpenHatch <http://openhatch.org/>`_ in a weekend workshop. The groups have
joined forces to create a beginner-friendly environment with a focus on
involving women of the community and introducing computer programming with
Python. There's no prerequisite knowledge required to attend, as the weekend
is planned for true beginners not just to Python but to programming in
general. For the full details, see
<https://openhatch.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Python_Workshop>.

One of the weekend's stated goals is to "increase Python community diversity
through programming outreach events." The event is female-focused and is
staffed primarily with women, and encourages attendees to bring a friend. For
men who are interested in the event, bring along a female friend to get
involved with you!

The group's organizers, `Catherine
Devlin <http://catherinedevlin.blogspot.com/>`_ and `Mel
Chua <http://melchua.com/>`_, with the help of Boston's `Jessica
McKellar <http://web.mit.edu/jesstess/>`_, want to get you writing _and
enjoying_ programming. Another goal of the event is to introduce and involve
the attendees in their local community, fostering growth of events such as
`Indiana LinuxFest <http://www.indianalinux.org/cms/>`_ (where the workshop
takes place) as well as local meetups and project nights.

If you're interested in coming out and joining the fun, sign up on the `IndyPy
Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/python-182/>`_ and sign up for `Indiana
LinuxFest <http://www.indianalinux.org/cms/>`_ as well!
