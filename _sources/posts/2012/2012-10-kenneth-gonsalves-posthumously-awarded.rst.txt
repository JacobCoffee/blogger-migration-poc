Kenneth Gonsalves Posthumously Awarded Community Service Award
==============================================================

*The Python Software Foundation, represented by director David Mertz,
posthumously awarded`Kenneth
Gonsalves <http://ilugcbe.org.in/index.php?title=Kenneth_Gonsalves>`_ with the
foundation’s `Community Service
Award <http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/>`_ for the third
quarter. The award was presented to his daughter last weekend at `PyCon
India <http://in.pycon.org/2012/>`_.  
  
Kenneth passed away on August 3, 2012 at the age of 59. After finding the open
source world in 1995, he was drawn to the Python community in 2003 and has
since taught over 50 seminars on Python and Django in his area. He was also a
major contributor to many mailing lists, generously helping as many people as
he could.  
  
Kenneth was known for founding and leading the `Indian Python Software
Society <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/ipss>`_, and is credited with
helping to shape the Python community all across India. He was also a well
known member of the Django community, where his presence and action will
surely be missed.  
  
Outside of software, Kenneth took interest in golf, even becoming a referee
and earning international certification. Throughout his time as an official he
was assigned to several national tournaments.  
  
In addition to the Community Service Award, the foundation presented a grant
of $3500 USD (~190K Rs) to the IPSS to seed an award in Kenneth’s name. The
award is planned to be given annually to a community member who goes above and
beyond to evangelize, innovate, and mentor other members of the Python
community. As much of Kenneth’s work was focused on students, the IPSS wants
to see further efforts in growing their community and educating the
membership.*
