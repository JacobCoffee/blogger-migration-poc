Welcome New PSF Members!
========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/08/welcome-new-psf-members.html>`_.

  

Just the other day the Python Software Foundation held an election, the second
and final one of the year, and the results are in! 18 new members were
introduced, and the membership approved three new sponsor members. Please join
us in welcoming all of them!

Candidates for PSF membership are nominated by an existing member for their
work in the Python community. The membership is comprised of people from
around the world and from many areas of the community.

These new members are selected from many different areas of the Python
community. While some members are known for their contributions of code, many
are known for their work to grow their local and regional communities. Some
members are known for their work in educational workshops and conferences. It
takes a diverse membership to ensure the success of a foundation steering a
diverse community, so we're happy to have members of all types from all areas,
both geographically and within the Python world.

Please join us in welcoming all of the new members to the Foundation!
