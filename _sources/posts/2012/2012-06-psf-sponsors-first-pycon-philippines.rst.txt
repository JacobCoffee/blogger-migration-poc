PSF Sponsors First PyCon Philippines
====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/06/psf-sponsors-first-pycon-philippines.html>`_.

  

The Python Software Foundation donated USD $600 to the first Python Conference
in the `Philippines <http://ph.pycon.org/>`_. The conference will be held in
Manila from June 30th to July 1st, 2012. The organizers behind this conference
are the Philippines Python User Group (PHPUG),
`pyDanny <http://pydanny.com/announcing-pycon-philippines.html>`_, Audrey Roy
and various other members of the Python community. You can meet and greet them
in a very nice tropical clime. Who wouldn't want to study Python on a
beautiful island? They're still accepting registrations, so act fast!
