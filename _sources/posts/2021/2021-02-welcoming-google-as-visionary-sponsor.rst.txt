Welcoming Google as a Visionary Sponsor of the PSF
==================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-sponsor.html>`_.

Our top sponsors—companies who step forward to make the biggest investment in
Python and its community—not only use Python for their own internal
development, but also offer Python as a crucial part of the products they
offer to their own customers. That is certainly true of Google, `the Python
Software Foundation’s first Visionary
Sponsor <https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/sponsors/>`_.

Google's donations and sponsorship funds will be used to support a number of
PSF initiatives, including the first CPython Developer in Residence. The
Python Steering Council and Python Software Foundation will work together to
contract a developer to help CPython determine what needs to take priority
through analytical metrics as well as helping CPython understand how backlog
can be addressed. The role will also be responsible for surveying maintainers
to paint a better landscape of CPython, which will be used to ensure future
funding and volunteer hours are used efficiently and effectively.

In addition, the sponsorship funds will also be used towards critical supply-
chain security improvements, including developing productized malware
detection for PyPI, a prototype of dynamic analysis infrastructure for
distributions, and other foundational tool improvements.

Google has been a Python Software Foundation sponsor since 2010. Our hearts
are full of gratitude for their support. `You can read more about how Google
is supporting the Python ecosystem on their
blog <https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/open-source/supporting-the-
python-ecosystem>`_.
