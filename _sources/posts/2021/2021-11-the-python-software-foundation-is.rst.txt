The Python Software Foundation Board of Directors has begun the search for its
next Executive Director. We’re looking for a leader who aligns with the PSF’s
mission and is able to lead an established, successful and growing
organization into its next stage.

What is the PSF?
----------------

The PSF is the 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation that holds the intellectual
property rights behind the Python programming language:

  

The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

— `https://www.python.org/psf/mission/ <https://www.python.org/psf/mission/>`_

  

To meet the Foundation’s mission, the PSF employs a growing team of `8 staff
members <https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/>`_ as well as several
contractors supporting specific initiatives. We produce PyCon US, support
development of CPython, The Python Package Index, and the open-source Python
ecosystem, support regional Python conferences and workshops around the world,
and fund Python related development with our grants program.

  

For more details about the PSF, you can read our `Annual Impact
Report <https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2020/>`_. Additional
information, including 990s and reports from past PSF board meetings, can be
found on our `public records <https://www.python.org/psf/records/>`_ webpage.  

The duties of the Executive Director
------------------------------------

The PSF Executive Director fulfills several duties within the organization to
promote the success of the Foundation’s mission as well as to secure its long
term health. This includes the creation of an annual budget, overseeing
operations and fundraising efforts, as well as managing the PSF staff and
community relations.

  

The Executive Director plays a critical role in the development and execution
of PSF programs and initiatives that fall within the mission of the PSF. In
addition to managing the PSF staff, the Executive Director works with the PSF
Board of Directors, the Python Steering Council, PSF Working Groups and the
broader Python community on events like PyCon US and other strategic projects
and alliances.
