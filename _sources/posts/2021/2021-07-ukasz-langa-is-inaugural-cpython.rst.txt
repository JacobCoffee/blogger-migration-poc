Łukasz Langa is the inaugural CPython Developer-in-Residence!
=============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/07/ukasz-langa-is-inaugural-cpython.html>`_.

  
The PSF and the Python Steering Council are pleased to announce that the
inaugural Developer-in-Residence role will be held by core developer Łukasz
Langa.  
  
CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is developed and primarily
maintained by volunteers. Inspired by the `Django Fellowship Program's
success <https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/>`_, the PSF has
strategically planned to support CPython in a similar way beginning this year.
Thanks to the support from sponsors such as Google, this effort is now being
put into motion!

Łukasz will work full-time for one year to assist CPython maintainers and the
Steering Council. Areas of responsibility will include analytical research to
understand the project's volunteer hours and funding, investigation of project
priorities and their tasks going forward, and begin working on those
priorities. Regular reporting and full transparency to the community are also
a large part of Łukasz’ role. If the program is impactful and the PSF raises
enough funds, there is potential for the Developer-in-Residence role to
continue beyond one year. We look forward to updating the community as work
progresses!
