Shamika Mohanan has joined the PSF as Packaging Project Manager
===============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/08/shamika-mohanan-has-joined-psf-as.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is excited to welcome Shamika Mohanan as
our new Packaging Project Manager! You can learn specifics about the role in
our `post announcing the position <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/04/the-
psf-is-hiring-python-packaging.html>`_.

Recognizing that the success of the Python language and community relies on
the success of its packaging ecosystem, the PSF is excited for the Packaging
Project Manager role to facilitate, coordinate, and amplify the existing
momentum in this space.

  

Shamika will be performing outreach to Python users to help the PSF better
understand the landscape, identify fundable initiatives, seek grants, oversee
funded projects, and report on their progress and results to improve Python
packaging for all users. Shamika will also work with the PSF Director of
Infrastructure to make progress on developing `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ into a
sustainable service that the community can continue to rely on for years to
come.

  

Once again we want to thank our `Visionary
Sponsor <https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/>`_
`Bloomberg <https://www.techatbloomberg.com/>`_ for their initiative in
“`Shifting Left <https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/supporting-the-python-
community-by-shifting-left/>`_” and supporting this role for its initial term of
two years.
