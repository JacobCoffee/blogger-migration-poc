The 2021 Python Language Summit
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-2021-python-language-summit.html>`_.

Every year, a small group of core developers from Python implementations such
as CPython, PyPy, Jython, and more come together to share information, discuss
problems, and seek consensus in order to help Python continue to flourish.  

The Python Language Summit features short presentations followed by group
discussions. The topics can relate to the language itself, the standard
library, the development process, documentation, packaging, and more! In 2021,
the summit was held over two days by videoconference and was led by Mariatta
Wijaya and Łukasz Langa.

If you weren't able to attend the summit, then you can still stay up to date
with what's happening in the world of Python by reading blog posts about all
of the talks that were given. Over the next few weeks, you'll be able to dive
into all of the news from the summit so you can join in on the big
conversations that are happening in the Python community.
