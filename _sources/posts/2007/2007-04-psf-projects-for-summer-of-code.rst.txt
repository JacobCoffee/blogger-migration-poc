Google has announced the list of accepted students in the 2007 Summer of Code

who applied and congratulations to the successful students. In addition to the
PSF, numerous other mentoring organization are running Python-related
projects.

Thanks to `James Tauber <http://www.jtauber.com>`_ for coordinating the
