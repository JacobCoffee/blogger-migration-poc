Donate to the Python Software Foundation!
=========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/12/donate-to-python-software-foundation.html>`_.

Please consider including the Python Software Foundation (PSF) in your year-
end charitable giving.

Your donation will help us protect the open source status of Python. The PSF
also provides the financial backing that makes PyCon possible, donates to
other Python conferences around the world, and funds grants and special
projects in the Python community.

For details of our activities, please see `the PSF pages on the Python
website <http://www.python.org/psf/>`_.

`You can donate here <http://www.python.org/psf/donations/>`_

Donations from individuals are tax deductible in the US and may be tax
deductible in other countries, or as a business expense. We take credit cards,
checks, wire transfers, and PayPal.

Sponsorship Opportunities for Businesses

Businesses invested in Python can also `become a sponsor
member <http://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/>`_ of the PSF.

Or `become a sponsor of PyCon 2008 <http://us.pycon.org/2008/sponsors/>`_, a
great way to gain exposure for your business or find talented Python
programmers to hire.

Thanks!
