Supporting Python user groups
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/06/supporting-python-user-groups.html>`_.

Advocacy coordinator Jeff Rush has created some new mailing lists and
resources for usergroup organizers, described in `his post to the Python
Advocacy weblog <http://python-advocacy.blogspot.com/2007/06/calling-
usergroup-organizers-and.html>`_. To summarize:

  * a weblog for `usergroup event reports <http://python-groups.blogspot.com/>`_
  * a mailing list for usergroup organizers, group-organizers 
  * an `updated list of usergroups <http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups>`_ (it's in the wiki, so be sure your local group is there) 
Jeff also suggests that groups can market themselves by writing articles or
recording video of presentations at their meetings. Please see his post for
more.
