Last call for proxy forms for PSF members' meeting
==================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/02/last-call-for-proxy-forms-for-psf.html>`_.

`PyCon <http://us.pycon.org>`_ begins next week. On the evening of Friday
February 23rd is the PSF's annual members' meeting. Many PSF members will be
in attendance, but for those who won't: *please send in your proxy forms or
absentee ballots NOW*! See ` the meeting
agenda <http://www.python.org/psf/records/members/2007-02-23/>`_ for links.
Forms have to be faxed or emailed to the PSF Secretary by Monday February 19;
full details are on the forms.

PSF members represent the Python community. The minimum commitment of each PSF
member is to vote in person or by proxy at annual Python Software Foundation
meetings and to keep the PSF updated with address changes. `See the PSF
Membership FAQ. <http://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_
