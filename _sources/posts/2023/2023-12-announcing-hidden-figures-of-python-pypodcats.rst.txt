The `Python Software Foundation <https://www.python.org/psf-landing/>`_ is
excited to share the launch of the `Hidden Figures of
Python <https://pypodcats.live/about/>`_, a new podcast series created by the
`PyPodcats <https://pypodcats.live/>`_. The Hidden Figures of Python series aims
to uplift underrepresented folks and their inspiring stories. `Episode
0 <https://pypodcats.live/episodes/ep-0>`_ is available now on the `PyPodcats
website <https://pypodcats.live/episodes>`_,
`Spotify <https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/pypodcats>`_, `Apple
Podcasts <https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/pypodcats/id1720808525>`_, and

> Hidden Figures of Python podcast series is hosted by the PyPodcats team:
> Cheuk Ting Ho, Georgi Ker, Mariatta Wijaya, and Tereza Iofciu. Our aim is to
> highlight voices of underrepresented group members of the Python community.
>
>  
>
>
> Within the realm of popular Python community podcasts, women make up less
> than 15% of podcast speaker guests.
>
>  
>
>
> We know that there are in fact many underrepresented members in our
> community who are contributing to the Python community, and they deserve to
> be seen and heard by the rest of us.
>
>  
>
>
> By creating this podcast series, we hope for the rest of the Python
> community to learn more about the underrepresented community members and to
> appreciate their contributions to the global Python community.

The Hidden Figures of Python Podcast has been created with care by treasured
