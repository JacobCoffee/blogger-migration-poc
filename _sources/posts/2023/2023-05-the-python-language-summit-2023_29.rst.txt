The Python Language Summit 2023
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-summit-2023_29.html>`_.

Every year, just before the start of PyCon US, core developers, triagers, and
special guests gather for the Python Language Summit: an all-day event of
talks where the future direction of Python is discussed. The Language Summit
2023 included three back-to-back talks on the C API, an update on work towards
making the Global Interpreter Lock optional, and a discussion on how to tackle
burnout in the community.

  

This year's summit received around 45 attendees, and the summit was covered by
Alex Waygood.
