Announcing Our New PyPI Safety & Security Engineer!
===================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/08/announcing-our-new-pypi-safety-security.html>`_.

We `announced our
intention <https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-09-announcing-pypi-safety-and-
security-engr-role/>`_ back in May to fill this role with `generous funding by
Amazon Web Services (AWS) <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/securing-
pypi-for-the-future/>`_, and after a thorough search, we are delighted to
announce `Mike Fiedler <https://mike.fiedler.me/>`_ is joining the team! He
joins the PSF for the next year as our first ever PyPI Safety & Security
Engineer. Mike is already a dedicated member of the Python packaging community
– he has been a Python user for some 15 years, maintains and contributes to
open source, and became a PyPI Maintainer in 2022.

This critical role would not be possible without funding from
`AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/>`_: "_We are happy to be able to invest
in the sustainable and secure development of Python and PyPI, and we look
forward to Mike's contributions_." - Tom Callaway, AWS.  
  
Mike begins his work with the `Python Packaging Index <http://pypi.org>`_ (PyPI)
this week. He says, “ _Very excited to join the team in improving the safety
and security of PyPI for end users, package publishers, maintainers, and PyPI
moderators and administrators - that’s a huge audience!_ ” We hope that
everyone in the community will join us in welcoming Mike and supporting his
critical work for Python packaging!

We are thrilled that for the first time we are able to bring on an engineer
who will be dedicated full-time to PyPI. PyPI is a massive project that has
become key digital infrastructure serving millions of users. Up until now,
PyPI has been almost entirely volunteer-run, depending on a tiny team with
only one fraction of one person’s paid time. We’re expecting all PyPI users to
have a tangibly improved experience from Mike’s work over the next year. Some
of the outcomes we are targeting include increased support for package
maintainers including multi-maintainer projects, improvements to reporting
infrastructure for malicious projects, as well as a reduced response time for
malware reports and account recovery requests. Mike will work closely with our
also-recently-announced `Security Developer in Residence, Seth
Larson <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/06/announcing-our-new-security-
developer.html>`_.  

  
This role is funded by a substantial investment from AWS, inaugural Security
Sponsor for PyPI. AWS has been one of the top sponsors of the Python Software
Foundation for the last five years, and our long-term partnership with AWS has
also included important in-kind donations of cloud computing infrastructure
and services to support PyPI.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is the non-profit organization behind
Python and PyPI. Our mission is to promote, protect, and advance the Python
programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse
and international community of Python programmers. The PSF supports the Python
community using corporate sponsorships, grants, and donations. Are you
interested in sponsoring or donating to the PSF so it can continue supporting
Python and its community? Check out our `sponsorship
