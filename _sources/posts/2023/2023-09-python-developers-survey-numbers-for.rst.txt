Python Developers Survey Numbers for 2022!
==========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/09/python-developers-survey-numbers-for.html>`_.

We are excited to announce the results of the sixth official annual Python
Developers Survey. This work is done each year as a collaborative effort
between the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains. Late last year, more
than 23,000 Python developers and enthusiasts from almost 200
countries/regions participated in the survey to reveal the current state of
the language and the ecosystem around it. (Spoiler alert: Many people are
using Python, and 51% are using it for both work AND personal projects.)

We know the whole Python community finds this work useful. From Luciana Abud,
product manager for Visual Studio Code, “Our teams at Microsoft are truly
grateful to the Python Software Foundation and JetBrains for orchestrating the
Python Developers Survey! The insights we gain allows us to take a data-driven
approach to help with prioritizing feature development, addressing pain
points, enhancing usability and anticipating future needs. This survey is
invaluable in shaping our approach and continuously improving the Python
development experience within the VS Code ecosystem!”

We’d love to hear how you use these numbers, so please share your thoughts on
social media, mentioning` @jetbrains <https://twitter.com/jetbrains>`_ and
`@ThePSF <https://fosstodon.org/@ThePSF>`_ with the #pythondevsurvey hashtag. We
are also open to any suggestions and feedback related to this survey which
could help us run an even better one next time.
