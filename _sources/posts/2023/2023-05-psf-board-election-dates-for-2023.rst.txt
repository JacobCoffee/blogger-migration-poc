You will need to be a contributing, managing, supporting, or fellow member by

here <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_ or if you have questions about
membership or nominations please email `psf-elections@python.org <mailto:psf-
elections@python.org>`_  
  
Who runs for the board? People that care about the Python community, who want
to see it flourish and grow and also have a few hours a month to attend
regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations and
promote the Python community. You can learn more about what the PSF board does
`here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M>`_.  
  
You can nominate yourself or someone else, but no one will be forced to run,
so you may want to consider reaching out to someone before nominating them.
Nominations open on June 1st, so you have a few weeks to research the role and
craft a nomination statement.  
  
You are welcome to join the discussion about the PSF Board election on `our
forum <https://discuss.python.org/c/python-software-foundation/9>`_ or come find
us `in Slack <https://psf-board.slack.com/>`_. This year weâ€™ll also be running
office hours in Telegraph to answer questions about running for the board and
serving on the board. Those will be announced soon!
