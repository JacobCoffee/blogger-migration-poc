Frank Willison Memorial Award Recipient Selected
================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/frank-willison-memorial-award-recipient.html>`_.

The 2010 Frank Willison Memorial Award for Services to the Python Community
has been awarded to `Christian Tismer <http://www.tismer.com/Home.html>`_.

Christian's contributions to the technology behind Python have focused on
performance. For example, he is the founder of the `Stackless
Python <http://www.stackless.com/>`_ project, a micro-threading system with the
first implementation of generators and continuations. You can learn more about
Stackless from the project's `history
page <http://www.disinterest.org/resource/stackless/2.6-docs-html/stackless-
python.html#history>`_ and this `IBM developerWorks interview with Christian by
David Mertz <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-pyth7.html>`_.

Christian also co-founded `PyPy <http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/>`_, an
implementation of Python _in_ Python, with Armin Rigo and Holger Krekel.
Christian worked on PyPy full time for a period, using EU funding. Later, he
worked on the JIT compiler `Psyco <http://www.psyco.org/>`_ with Raymond
Hettinger to create `Psyco V2 <http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-
dev/2009q3/005288.html>`_. Most recently, he has been employed by `CCP
Games <http://www.ccpgames.com/>`_ to work on combining Stackless and Psyco and
updating them to support 64-bit systems.

In 1997, as one of his earliest contributions to the Python community,
Christian launched the `Starship Python <http://starship.python.net/>`_ website.
That was a time when setting up your own server online required considerable
effort, and hosting services were nascent and expensive. Starship `filled an
important
gap <http://web.archive.org/web/19990423001035/starship.python.net/intro.txt>`_
as a free playground and hosting site for Python programmers. Members of the
Python Software Activity (the forerunner of the PSF) were given preference
when requesting accounts on the Starship, which had the effect of increasing
membership in the PSA from 60 to 300

The Starship site was quite popular (by 2000 it had `over 250 "crew
members" <http://web.archive.org/web/20001204140200/starship.python.net/crew.html>`_),
and moved several times, with several other volunteers helping with the system
administration. `Old versions of the
site <http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://starship.python.net/>`_ are available
through the `Internet Archive Way Back
Machine <http://www.archive.org/web/web.php>`_. A revived version is running on
one of Christian's servers now, but because hosting services are much easier
to find today, he is looking for another concept to give it a renewed purpose.

When he's not working on Python, Christian enjoys watching movies, reading,
and practicing playing piano. You can follow him on twitter
