Review  
  
Although the above apparently represents just twelve hours of board meetings,
of necessity many of the actions detailed have required a lot of time in
preparatory work such as discussions and negotiations. I am grateful to my
fellow directors and the other officers for the work they have put in to try
and develop the Foundation.  
  
Besides this formal stuff I personally have continued outreach work to such
user groups as I have been able to attend, and I would encourage other
directors to do the same. At every meeting I have found a groundswell of
interest in and support for the Foundation's activities that is both
gratifying and humbling.  
  
I have also undertaken preparatory investigations to allow us to undertake
"fiscal sponsorship", a scheme that will effectively let user groups and other
affiliated organizations make use of the Foundation's charitable status by
raising funds in a way that allows donors a tax deduction without the need for
formal incorporation as a 501(c)3 or similar. I hope that this will also allow
the Foundation to start sponsoring sprint activities that will get developers
together at crucial times to ensure that development velocity can be
maintained.  
  
We have produced the first issue of a quarterly newsletter (small quantities
were available at PyCon) which will be the primary communications channel with
the new associate members I hope we will shortly see swelling our ranks (and
our coffers). Without the preparatory work to bring the membership management
system on-line this development would not have been practical.  
  
While the Foundation is not yet as organized as I would like to see it we have
made some kind of start in a new direction. The financial problems of 2009 did
not make things easy. Much remains to be done, but overall we are much better
placed to move forward than we were a year ago.
