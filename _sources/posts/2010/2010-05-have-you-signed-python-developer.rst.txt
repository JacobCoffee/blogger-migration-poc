Have You Signed a Python Developer Contributor Agreement Yet?
=============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/05/have-you-signed-python-developer.html>`_.

A key aspect of the Python Software Foundation's
`mission <http://python.org/psf/mission/>`_ is managing the intellectual
property for the Python language. This includes the source code for the C
implementation of the Python interpreter, the Python standard library, and any
related tools and documentation. In order to share the source code and
documentation with users of Python, the PSF needs to hold a valid license that
gives us permission to do so. The licensing requirement applies to every
contribution, so the PSF board is contacting all contributors to make sure
they have filled out a `contributor
agreement <http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/>`_.

In June 2009, Andrew Kuchling analyzed the svn repository for CPython and
compared the actual contributor names with the list of people who had signed
an agreement. 39% of the lines in the Python 2.7 portion of the tree were
committed by developers without signed agreements. Around 31% of the lines for
Python 3.1 came from unsigned contributors. Through the efforts of Andrew and
other PSF members, those statistics improved to 8.5% for Python 2.7 and 9.9%
for Python 3.1 by February of 2010.

Our goal is 100% coverage, so if _you_ have contributed source code or
documentation, either directly or via a patch in the `issue
tracker <http://bugs.python.org/>`_, please make sure you have submitted a form.
If you are unsure of your status, you can check your `issue
tracker <http://bugs.python.org/>`_ account by logging in and then clicking the
"Your Details" link in the left sidebar. The account details page includes a
"Contributor Form Received" field, which will show the date the form was
filed. If the field says no agreement was received, please take a few minutes
to fill out the `contributor agreement <http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/>`_
and send it in. If you think you have already signed an agreement but the
tracker does not show it, contact `psf@python.org <mailto:psf@python.org>`_ so
we can check our records.
