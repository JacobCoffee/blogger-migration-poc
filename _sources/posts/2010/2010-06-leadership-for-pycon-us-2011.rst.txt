Leadership for PyCon US 2011
============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/leadership-for-pycon-us-2011.html>`_.

The PyCon organizing committee has started making plans for PyCon US 2011, to
be held in Atlanta, GA on March 9-17 of next year. One of the first steps is
ensuring that the conference committee leadership is in place.

Van Lindberg returns as Conference Chair this year. Van manages all of the
activities related to running `PyCon US <http://us.pycon.org/>`_, including
organizing the volunteer and paid efforts.

This year Jesse Noller will be assisting Van as Vice Chair. Jesse's primary
responsibility is serving as the Program Committee Chair, but he will work
with Van in other areas as well.

Doug Napoleone will be the Technical Chair. He is overseeing the redevelopment
of the PyCon web site, including the talk selection and schedule management
software. Doug will also be responsible for coordinating the technical vendors
for the conference, including A/V, networking, and recording.

Greg Lindstrom is returning as Tutorials Coordinator. Greg has been organizing
tutorials for a number of years, and his patience and skill have been a big
factor in the successful tutorial program that has grown from eight tutorials
several years ago to the `32 sessions we regularly have
now <http://us.pycon.org/2010/tutorials/>`_.

Vern Ceder is returning for a second year as Poster Sessions Coordinator. The
poster sessions were `one of the big hits at PyCon
2010 <http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/posters/>`_, and we expect that they
will be much bigger for 2011.

Volunteering
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although having good leadership is important, five people cannot organize a
conference as big as PyCon. The organizing committee depends on the
participation of _dozens_ of volunteers from the community to do most of the
work. If you would like to help, join the `PyCon organizers mailing
list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pycon-organizers>`_ and follow
`the blog <http://pycon.blogspot.com/>`_ to keep up with other announcements.
