High School Students Program Robots with Python
===============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/12/high-school-students-program-robots.html>`_.

Vern Ceder's Canterbury High School students are learning to program in Python
by making robots play music, find objects in the room, and perform other
challenging tasks. The local paper, `The Fort Wayne Journal
Gazette <http://www.jg.net/>`_, wrote `a story about the
class <http://www.jg.net/article/20101206/LOCAL04/312069949>`_ earlier this
month, and Vern blogs about how he arranged that on the `Learn Python
blog <http://learnpython.wordpress.com/2010/12/12/python-in-the-news/>`_ for the
benefit of other members of the community with similar projects.

Congratulations to the students at Canterbury High, and keep up the good work!
