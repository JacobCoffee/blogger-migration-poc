New Trademarks Committee Chair
==============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/new-trademarks-committee-chair.html>`_.

David Mertz has been appointed Chair of the PSF's `Trademarks
Committee <http://www.python.org/psf/committees/#trademarks-committee-tmc>`_ for
2010-2011.

The use of all trademarks is governed by specific legal requirements. Those
rules apply to trademarks for open source software projects such as
`Python <http://www.python.org/>`_, just as they do for commercial products.
Failure to meet the requirements may result in the loss of the trademark, so
the PSF takes this responsibility seriously.

The Trademarks Committee is responsible for assessing the use of PSF
trademarks for compliance with our
`policies <http://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/>`_ and advising the Board if
questions arise. Most requests are related to the use of the name "Python" or
the official logo by groups or conferences promoting Python. When the use is
appropriate and the logo is unaltered, permission is usually easy to grant.

Other members of the committee are:

  * David Goodger
  * Marc-Andr√© Lemburg
  * Van Lindberg
  * Doug Napoleone
  * James Tauber
  * Trevor Toenjes

Besides the regular members of the committee, Carl Tracthe and Gloria
Willadsen have acted as advisors at the request of the Chair.
