PSF supports 2010 SciPy India
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/12/psf-supports-2010-scipy-india.html>`_.

\-->

The Python Software Foundation has awarded a USD $1250 grant to help fund
sprints at the 2010 `SciPy India Conference <http://scipy.in/>`_, being held in
Hyderabad between December 13th and 18th. The conference consists of two days
of talks, three days of a combination of morning tutorials and afternoon
coding sprints, as well as an additional full day of sprints. The conference
focuses heavily on tutorials and coding sprint, as the adoption of Python for
scientific programming is not as wide-spread in India as it is in the US and
Europe.

Since the Scipy India Conference targets students and faculty, it is essential
that costs are kept as low as possible for attendees. To that end, most of the
conference costs are covered by `FOSSEE <http://fossee.in/>`_ (Free and Open-
source Software for Science and Engineering Education). PSF support will help
in the overall organization, especially now that the conference more than
doubled in size this year.
