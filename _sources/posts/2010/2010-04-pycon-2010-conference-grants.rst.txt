At their April 12 meeting, the PSF Board approved grants for two PyCon
conferences.

PyCon Italia

`PyCon Italia Quattro <http://www.pycon.it/>`_ is scheduled for May 7-9 in in
the old city centre of Florence. The organizers are planning three tracks of
talks and anticipate more than 400 delegates. The PSF Board approved a grant
of $4000US to help with conference expenses.

Kiwi PyCon

`Kiwi PyCon <http://nz.pycon.org/>`_ is being organized by the `New Zealand

in Waitangi, New Zealand. There will be a series of traditional scheduled
talks, as well as BarCamp-style sessions. The PSF Board approved a grant of
NZ$1,000 to defray expenses.
