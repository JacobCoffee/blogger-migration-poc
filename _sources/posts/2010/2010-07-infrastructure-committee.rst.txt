Infrastructure Committee
========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/infrastructure-committee.html>`_.

The PSF Board has approved the appointment of Sean Reifschneider as chair of
the Infrastructure Committee for 2010-2011. Prior to this, Sean has served as
a committee member and handled system adminstration tasks for the python.org
servers. He works for tummy.com, a Linux hosting and consulting company, and
has years of experience with system administration and hosting.

The Infrastructure Committee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Infrastructure Committee is responsible for the technical details of the
Foundation's presence on the internet. They manage web server space, email,
DNS registrations, software application hosting for tools such as bug trackers
and PyPI, and all of the other tasks around maintaining a professional
presence on the net. If the PSF puts something on the internet, the
Infrastructure Committee is involved with it in some way.

The other members of the committee are:

Thomas Wouters is the liaison between the PSF and
`XS4ALL <http://www.xs4all.nl/>`_, the Dutch ISP that generously hosts many of
the servers for python.org. Thomas has been contributing time and energy since
the servers were originally moved from CNRI to XS4ALL, and still handles a lot
of the on-site hardware service when needed.

Martin v. LÃ¶wis handles a lot of the system administration tasks on the PSF's
servers. He manages DNS and development tools like subversion, Buildbot, and
the Roundup issue tracker instances for Python-dev, Jython, and setuptools.
Martin is also the primary developer of the software behind the Python Package
Index, `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/>`_.

Andrew Kuchling joined the committee during the migration from SourceForge to
Roundup several years ago. He also wrote the templating system used for
python.org content, and is still involved with the content management.

Barry Warsaw is another long-time member of the committee. He has been
intimately involved in the email infrastructure, including the development and
configuration of the Mailman mailing list management software. Today he acts
primarily as an advisor to the other team members.

Volunteers
^^^^^^^^^^

Besides the formal committee members, there are two teams of volunteers who do
a lot of the day-to-day work for us.

The postmaster team, including Brad Knowles, Skip Montanaro, Ralf Hildebrandt,
Patrick Ben Koetter, and Martijn Pieters, run all of the email services for
python.org. That includes individual accounts and aliases for contributors
with @python.org addresses along with the Mailman `mailing
lists <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo>`_ and an NNTP-SMTP gateway for
the newsgroups. Their motto is "_Low spam, high deliverability!_ "

The _pydotorg-www_ group serves as webmaster for
`python.org <http://www.python.org/>`_. Their responsibilities include typical
webmaster duties, content management, and wiki curation. For example, Michael
Foord helps with moderation of the python-dev mailing list as well as editing
website content, including managing the `Planet
Python <http://planet.python.org/>`_ feeds; Martin Thomas adminsters the `Job
Board <http://python.org/community/jobs/>`_ and news sections of the site; and
Aahz triages and responds to email sent to the webmaster alias and handles
some of the site updates directly.

Upcoming Initiatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Infrastructure Committee has several projects planned for this year:

  1. Establishing a ticketing system for managing internal Foundation business (not Python development). The Board and designated committees will use the new system for managing tasks and project plans.
  2. Complete the move from Subversion to Mercurial for Python development, including any changes necessary to host the new repositories.
  3. Seek an increase of our bandwidth to better handle recent spikes in traffic to the python.org sites, especially from users downloading new releases of the installation program for the interpreter.

Volunteering
^^^^^^^^^^^^

To volunteer to help with the _pydotorg-www_ team, see the `Maintenance and
Administration <http://www.python.org/dev/pydotorg/>`_ page for instructions.

Committee, contact Sean directly at _jafo at tummy.com_.
