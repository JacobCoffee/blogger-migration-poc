Seeking Developers for Paid Contract Improving pip
==================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/11/seeking-developers-for-paid-contract.html>`_.

The `Python Software Foundation <https://python.org/psf-landing>`_ `Packaging
Working Group <https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#packaging-work-group>`_ is
receiving funding to work on the design, implementation, and rollout of pip's
next-generation dependency resolver. (We'll be able to publicly name the
funders later this month and in early December.)

`pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`_ is the official `package
installer <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/current/>`_ for Python. pip
aims to make it easy for the millions of people who use Python to download and
install Python libraries and applications (open source and closed source,
source and binary, globally and within isolated virtual environments). It's a
foundational component of the `Python <https://python.org>`_ ecosystem and
broader computer software and technology landscape.

This project aims to complete the `design, implementation, and
rollout <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6536>`_ of `pip's next-generation
dependency resolver <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988>`_. This will lower
the barriers to installing Python software, empowering users to get a version
of a package that works. It will also lower the barriers to distributing
Python software, empowering developers to make their work available in an
easily reusable form.

Because of the size of the project, funding has been allocated to secure _two
contractors_ , a _senior developer_ and an _intermediate developer_ , to work
on development, testing and building test infrastructure, code review, bug
triage, and assisting in the rollout of necessary features.

We plan to begin the project in Quarter 1 of 2020. We are also interested in
senior developer candidates who are available to start in December 2019.

Timeline and budget
-------------------

Date | Milestone  
---|---  
November 11 | Request for Proposal period opens.  
November 22 | Request for Proposal period closes.  
November 27 | Date proposals will have received a decision.  
December 31 | Latest date for contracts for accepted proposals to be finalized.  
January 2 | Latest date for contract work to commence.  
  
Role 1: We seek a senior Python developer, work starting in mid-December 2019
or early January 2020, work ending at the end of May 2020. Pay: $116,375 total
(665 hours of work at $175 per hour).

Role 2: We seek an intermediate-to-senior Python developer, work starting in
early January 2020, till the end of December 2020. Pay: $103,700 (670 hours of
work at $150 per hour), plus $1600 budgeted for onboarding travel and $1600
budgeted for `PyCon <https://us.pycon.org/2020/>`_ travel.

What is the Request for Proposals period?
-----------------------------------------

*A Request for Proposals (RFP)* is a process intended to allow us (the
Python Software Foundation) to collect proposals from potential contractors
and select contractor(s) best suited to fulfill the specified work.

After the RFP period closes we will evaluate the received proposals based on
the `evaluation criteria <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/master/2020-pip/RFP.md#evaluation-criteria>`_, seek clarification from
proposers as necessary, and select one or more contractors to complete the
work specified in the `scope section <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/master/2020-pip/RFP.md#scope>`_.

*Note* : This Request For Proposal document may be updated to reflect things
that we learn during the process. The canonical version and history is
available `here <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/master/2020-pip/RFP.md>`_.

How do I submit a proposal?
---------------------------

First, please read `the full contents of the Request for
Proposals <https://github.com/python/request-for/blob/master/2020-pip/RFP.md>`_!

You'll find the `instructions for
submission <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/master/2020-pip/RFP.md#how-do-i-submit-a-proposal>`_, `evaluation
criteria <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/master/2020-pip/RFP.md#evaluation-criteria>`_, as well as the `scopes
of the two roles <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/master/2020-pip/RFP.md#scope>`_, there.
