Commencing Security, Accessibility, and Internationalization Improvements to PyPI for 2019
==========================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/03/commencing-security-accessibility-and.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) and PSF Packaging Working Group are
excited to announce that the first round of `slated improvements to PyPI for
2019 <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/12/upcoming-pypi-improvements-
for-2019.html>`_ are underway. This `Open Technology
Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/>`_ funded project will bring improvements to
the accessibility and security of the service. You can read more about the
scope of this project in our `request for proposals
document <https://github.com/python/request-
for/blob/7d83a300e583474097d16af6e2c71c92d58f3762/2019-Q1-PyPI/RFP.md>`_.  
  
We are excited to have two returning contractors from the `MOSS
funded <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-awarded-moss-grant-
pypi.html>`_ work that brought the full rewrite of PyPI into
`production <https://pypi.org/>`_.  




`Kabu Creative <https://kabucreative.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Responsible for the user interface and user experience of
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_, Kabu Creative will be fulfilling those aspects of
new features for the project. Additionally, we are excited for their work on
auditing and improving the accessibility of PyPI's web user interface.




`Changeset Consulting, LLC <https://changeset.nyc/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With experience in project management, communications, and contributions for
projects and teams across the realm of open source, Changeset Consulting will
be responsible for helping to lead the project to completion. Along the way
Changeset Consulting will also be performing reporting, communications, and
outreach to help keep the Python community up to speed on how the project is
progressing.

  

We are also welcoming a new contractor to the team to complete this project.

  

`Trail of Bits <https://www.trailofbits.com/>`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bringing their experience securing organizations and products, Trail of Bits
will be handling the backend development related to the security milestones of
the project, as well as the backend development necessary for implementing
internationalization of the PyPI user interface.

  

  

The PSF looks forward to sharing more here as features are developed and
deployed to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_. Subscribe to `pypi-
