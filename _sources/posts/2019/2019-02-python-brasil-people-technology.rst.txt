Python Brasil – People > Technology
===================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/python-brasil-people-technology.html>`_.

It's October 17th, 2018. I've arrived at Natal, a beautiful coastal city in
Brazil's northeast region. Known for its beaches and hotness, it's surprising
how I'm not thinking about all the
`Caipirinhas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha>`_ I'm going to drink at
the shore after the conference. My excitement is because I'm going to attend
[Python Brasil[14]](https://www.blogger.com/)!  
  
After six months out of my home country, I'm thrilled to once again join this
conference, now as an attendee and speaker. It's only my second edition – out
of prior fourteen – but enough to know how great Python Brasil is. Full of
amazing people, talks, tutorials and evening happy hours, this is possibly the
most fun Python conference in the world. Seriously.  
  

It's big
~~~~~~~~

  

Lasting for 6 days, 784 people attended the event. Out of that, 153 were women
and about 120 students. Within 4 different tracks, there were about 120 talks,
30 lightning talks and 6 keynotes, being the first Python Brasil to
`livestream <https://www.facebook.com/pg/pythonbrasil/videos/>`_ the whole main
conference.

  

Additionally, 5 tutorials, 1 sprint day and 1 independently organized Django
Girls were held for those wanting more practical hands on. All of this was
possible due to an outstanding organization team and the `support and
sponsorship <https://2018.pythonbrasil.org.br/patrocinadores>`_ from 8 entities.

  

It's incredible how the biggest Python Brasil ever still feels so much like a
family.

  

A beginner friendly conference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcoming beginners is one of the pillars in this community. To make it
happen, the organization team created a specially priced ticket pack for the
IFRN (Federal Institute of Rio Grande do Norte), allowing them to bring over
120 young students from 3 different cities. It was beautiful to see all these
students around, watching talks, talking to the speakers and enjoying every
moment of the conference.

  

During the sprints, a group of students learned about data scraping. In a
world where it is very hard to capture the attention of youths, it was
fascinating to witness how they were so focused on learning. It demonstrates
how a small gesture – like discounts on a ticket – can change people's lives.

  

To express their gratitude, one of the students wrote and
`presented <https://twitter.com/gabubellon/status/1054126829483761670>`_ during
the lighting talks a Python Brasil themed
`Cordel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordel_literature>`_ – a pamphlet with
novels, poems and songs, very popular in that region – bringing some of the
attendees to tears.

Financial Aid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides the support for the students cited above, tickets were granted for
people unable to pay for them. To justify the concession, the person needed to
tell their history. After reviewing the applications, 6 out of 7 tickets were
donated.

  

Let's talk about Open Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A different keynote was presented on the second day: a panel about Open Data
and Civic Technologies. Mediated by Mário Sérgio, five participants discussed
topics like what is open data, how our legislation is currently dealing with
it, tackling fake news, and what the expectations for the future are. In the
light of Brazil's last election – which also happened in October – it was a
perfect moment to create a debate and demystify the subject.

PyLadiesBRConf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first PyLadiesBRConf was organized to celebrate the PyLadies Brasil 5 year
anniversary. The motto of the conference was to help more women become active
members of the Python community, inspiring those who were recently getting
involved.  
  
Independently organized by the PyLadies, the conference happened one day
before Python Brasil. The event was totally free, receiving about 120 women,
with 8 speakers and ending in a fishbowl discussion. Likewise, the whole
organization committee was formed only by women volunteers.  
  
The main organizer, `Débora Azevedo <https://twitter.com/pydebb>`_, said that it
was five years cultivating the community, involving a lot of hard work to get
them to this point.

Dorneles Treméa Award
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Named after the founder of the Python Brasil Association, `the
award <https://python.org.br/premio-dorneles-tremea/>`_ is a tribute to Dorneles
Treméa, a developer, community member, and open source leader, always willing
to help and share his knowledge, who sadly passed away in a car accident in
2011. The award is given to the member or members of the Python Brazilian
community who keep alive the spirit of collaboration, entrepreneurship, and
commitment.

  

In this edition of Python Brasil, it was given to `Filipe
Cifali <https://twitter.com/FilipeCifali>`_, `Humberto
Rocha <https://twitter.com/humrochagf>`_ and `Rudá Porto
Filgueiras <https://twitter.com/rudaporto>`_, for their incredible work at
running and maintaining the Python Brasil and the Python Brasil Association
online infrastructure.

The Challenges and the Future, by the Staff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the organization committee, scalability and inclusiveness were
the biggest challenges for running the conference this year.  
  
Ítalo Rossi, the Big Kahuna (chair):  

> _"The conference was initially planned for 400 attendees, but we ended up
> with it with 784. Adapting the budget, venues, and logistics was a big
> challenge."_

  
Ítalo Monteiro:  

> _"The challenge was to promote the best infrastructure for the biggest
> Python Brasil in history, making it a safe space for everyone, not accepting
> any kind of prejudice or intolerance."_

When asked about the future of the conference and the community, all of the
organizers said they wanted to improve the diversity of the event even
further. Having more women attending and speaking, more participation of
beginners and more involvement of minorities. Additionally, they all want to
have a bigger and more united community, believing in its growth, visibility,
and engagement.

  

People > Technology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My first contact with the Python community was at Python Brasil in 2016 and it
changed my life.  
A lot of the experiences and opportunities that I had – personally and
professionally – came from being part of it. It's not just about the
technology, it's about the people.  
  
Of course, this wasn't the _whole_ conference, there's no way to cover every
amazing thing that happened there. At least, I hope to get you excited to go
to the next one!  
  
I'd like to say thanks to all the organization committee and everyone involved
in putting together this superb conference and helping me with this article.
