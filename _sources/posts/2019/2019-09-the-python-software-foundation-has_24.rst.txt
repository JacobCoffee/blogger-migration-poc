The Python Software Foundation has updated its Code of Conduct
==============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/09/the-python-software-foundation-has_24.html>`_.

The Python community values members who are accepting, helpful, and
respectful: for many years, the Python Software Foundation (PSF) has had an
organization-wide Code of Conduct that defines these values, and behaviors
that we want to have in our community. The Foundation has also insisted for
years that every event that we sponsor have a Code of Conduct in place.  
  
But spaces where our community meets – online, or in person – need a Code of
Conduct that does more than just emphasize our values. The PSF’s flagship
conference, PyCon US, has had its own Code of Conduct – separate from the PSF
Code of Conduct – for many years. The PyCon US Code of Conduct not only
highlights our community’s values, but it also identified behaviors that are
not acceptable at the conference, explained how to report violations, and
included enforcement procedures.  
  
The PSF Board approved a new `organization-wide Code of
Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/>`_ and `enforcement
guidelines <https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/enforcement/>`_ at the August
2019 board meeting, and `reporting
guidelines <https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/reporting/>`_ at the September
2019 board meeting, taking effect immediately.  
  
Our new Code of Conduct brings together the statement of values defined in the
former PSF Code of Conduct, and enforcement guidelines – proven through our
experience at PyCon US – that the PSF can now apply to every space that we
oversee.  
  
It saves the PSF from having to enforce two Codes of Conduct: one for PyCon
US, and another for our other spaces. In crafting the Code of Conduct, we
undertook an intentional effort to account for the unique needs of an
international community that spans all seven continents on Earth.  
  
Community members will now know that if they’re participating in an online
space, a project, or an event facilitated by the PSF they will be subject to
the same Code of Conduct, and will be able to report incidents in the same
way.  
  
The process of defining the new Code of Conduct was led by the PSF’s `Conduct
Working Group <https://wiki.python.org/psf/ConductWG/Charter>`_, which the PSF
established in 2018. The PSF worked with Sage Sharp of `Otter
Tech <https://otter.technology/coc-procedures-review/>`_ to produce the draft of
the new Code of Conduct. Sage has previously worked on the Codes of Conduct
for Open Source communities including the Data Carpentries, Elastic Search,
and GNOME, and previously worked with the PSF on modernizing PyCon US’ Code of
Conduct and incident response procedures.  
  
In the future, the Conduct Working Group will help the Board oversee the
reporting and enforcement of Code of Conduct reports, following the
enforcement guidelines that accompany the new Code of Conduct.  
  
The Board thanks the Conduct Working Group, and Sage Sharp for their
invaluable service in getting our new Code of Conduct in place.
