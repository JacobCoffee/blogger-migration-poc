Python Community service award Q3: Mario Corchero
=================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/python-community-service-award-q3-mario.html>`_.

  
  
  
The PSF community service awards go to those individuals whose work and
commitment complement and strengthen the PSF mission: to support and
facilitate the growth of a diverse global Python community. So when thinking
about individuals that go above and beyond to support the global community
`Mario Corchero <https://twitter.com/mariocj89>`_ is a name that comes easily to
mind.  
  
  
Not only is Mario a Senior Software Engineer for Bloomberg but he also devotes
incredible amounts of his time to organise `PyCon ES
(Spain <https://twitter.com/pycones>`_),
`PyLondinium <https://twitter.com/pylondinium>`_, and more recently, the Spanish
speaking track of PyCon: `Las Pycon
Charlas <https://twitter.com/pyconcharlas>`_.  
  
Mario is the true embodiment of the Python community spirit and for this
reason, the Python Software Foundation has awarded Mario Corchero with the Q3
2018 Community Service Award.  
  

*RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the Q3 2018 Community
Service Award to Mario Corchero for helping organize PyLondinium, the PyCon
Charlas track, and PyCon Spain.*

Mario's contributions to the Python Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

PyConES
^^^^^^^

  
With the growing popularity and global adoption of Python there also comes the
need to bring together diverse community groups. Although large events such as
PyCon US are incredibly important in bringing these groups together, these are
not always accessible to the whole community. Smaller, localized events such
as Python ES, France, Namibia, Colombia, and many many others help with the
goal of bringing cohesion to the global community.  
  
According to `David Naranjo <https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidnaranjob/>`_ (co-
organiser of PyConES), PyConES was the first event of this kind that he and
Mario attended together. They loved it so much that while at PyConES16 they
decided to submit an application to organise and bring this event to their
region: Extremadura.  
  
On top of the many challenges that come with organising an event of this type
(i.e. drafting the programme, getting talks accepted, running the event on the
day), they have faced an additional layer of complexity: neither of them lives
in the region anymore.  
  
This has made the organisation of PyConES a true community effort: from the
organising committee to the sponsors and the volunteers that work together to
make this a huge success. PyConEs is now a  staple Python event in Europe with
more than 600 attendees every year, and it owes its success in a great deal to
Mario’s efforts.  
  
  
  

PyLondinium
^^^^^^^^^^^

  
A year after organising his first PyConES, Mario embarked on yet another
journey: the organisation of `PyLondinium <https://pylondinium.org/>`_. An event
focused on showcasing the many use cases of Python as opposed to other events
such as the PyData events.  
  
  
PyLondinium is not only focused on bringing together the Python community but
also to raise money for the PSF and its programmes around the world. In this
particular case, Bloomberg, a long-time Python supporter, has played an
important role in the success of the event. Not only do they host the event at
their Europe headquarters in the heart of London but they also help to cover
some of the costs as the main event sponsor, keeping the ticket prices at an
affordable level.

Accessibility for the wider community
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  

As a passionate community builder, from a non-English speaking country,
localization and accessibility of the Python language is something that
matters to Mario. Most of the coding resources out in the world are written in
English, which can be a barrier to those whose primary language is not English
or simply do not speak the language at all. That is why when he was presented
with the opportunity to chair the Spanish track of PyCon US 2017 (`Las PyCon
Charlas <https://twitter.com/pyconcharlas>`_) he did so wholeheartedly,
embarking into yet another community journey alongside PSF Director Naomi
Ceder.  
  
Again, like his other endeavours, Las Charlas was an absolute success. It
gathered people from all over from Latin America and Spain for a full day of
talks in Spanish on such topics as machine learning, astronomy and security.
In fact, it was such a success that the Charlas is back this coming year and
the organisers are already receiving talks submissions (for more details visit

When asked why he organises all of these events, his answer is rather simple
and honest. It is usually driven by a ‘how come no one is doing this yet?’"
says Mario. But when digging deeper it becomes evident that Mario’s
motivations lie in bringing the community together and nurturing it. Mario is
extremely dedicated to the community and helping others to get involved. From
creating Spanish tracks for PyCon USA or creating events serving specific
areas or regions, Mario is constantly finding ways to bring Pythonistas
together.
