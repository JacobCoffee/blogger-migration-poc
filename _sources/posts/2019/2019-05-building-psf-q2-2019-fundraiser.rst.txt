Building the PSF: the Q2 2019 Fundraiser
========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/building-psf-q2-2019-fundraiser.html>`_.




  
Thank you to everyone who has donated to our past fundraisers! Donations,
memberships, and sponsorships support sprints, meetups, community events,
Python documentation, fiscal sponsorships, software development, and community
projects.  
  
We can’t do any of this without your financial contributions. We’ve just
launched a `new fundraiser
 <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/2019-q2-drive/>`_for 2019! Please donate
today and help us meet our goal of $60,000 by June 30th!  




Your donations have IMPACT!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  

  * The PSF awarded $118,543 in financial aid to 143 PyCon attendees in 2018
  * $324,000 was paid in grants in 2018 to recipients in 51 different countries
  * Donations and fundraisers resulted in $489,152 of revenue. This represents 15% of our total 2018 revenue. 
  * PSF and PyCon sponsors contributed over $1,071K in revenue!

  
We understand the need for transparency and hope to help our community and
stakeholders find necessary information about the PSF in a single place. We’re
proud to launch our first ever `Annual
Report <https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2019/>`_. 2018 was a year of
growth for the PSF while still focussing on sustainability for our staff and
community. We’re excited to share these data points with you!  




Something new this year - the PSF and Jet Brains!
