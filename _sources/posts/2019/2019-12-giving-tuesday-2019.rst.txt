Comments from grant recipients:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"The PSF Fiscal Sponsorship allows us to focus on building community, while
they handle our non-profit status, accounting, and back office." - Eric
Holscher, PyCascades Conference Organizer  
  
"The PSF was North Bay Python's first sponsor. Their early financial support
for our mission helped kickstart what has become one of the most well-regarded
regional conferences in our community." - Christopher Neugebauer, Conference
Organizer  
  
"Without the support of the PSF, our events would not have been possible. Many
of our attendees are now working or interning as Python or Django Developers."
- Jeel Mehta, Django Girls Bhavnagar, India Conference Volunteer  
  
"The PSF grant allowed us to run an all day workshop for women. More
organizations should apply for a PSF grant so they can enable and motivate
more people, especially minorities, to start their great journey into
programming." - Women in Technology, Peru
