Humble Bundle sells games, ebooks, software, and other digital content. Their
mission is to support charity while providing awesome content to customers at
great prices. Thanks to past Humble Bundles that the PSF has been a part of,
this program has helped the PSF raise more than $300,000 since 2017! The PSF
and the Python community thank Humble Bundle and all of the featured products
that have selected the PSF as one of their charities. This funding has had a
positive impact for Pythonistas all around the world.  
  
No Starch is a long time community contributor supporting the PSF in various
Bundles and supporting Young Coder classes that happen at PyCon US.  “As one
of the leading publishers of Python books worldwide, No StarchPress is very
excited to support the organization at the core of the Python programming
language” said No Starch Press Founder Bill Pollock. “Python is at the core of
so much technical work today and very much at the core of our publishing
program.”  
  
The PSF staff and board of directors send a big "_Thank You!_ " to everyone
involved.
