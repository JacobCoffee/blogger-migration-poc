Chris Angelico: 2019 Q2 Community Service Award Winner
======================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/10/chris-angelico-2019-q2-community.html>`_.

The Python language is used around the world, and therefore so much
surrounding it happens online. Python users turn to wikis, mailing lists, and
forums to get their questions answered and concerns addressed. Python core
developers use mailing lists to decide on critical additions and timelines.
All this requires trusted and experienced contributors and administrators to
ensure these wikis and mailing lists are focused on the Python language.
`Chris Angelico <https://twitter.com/rosuav>`_ is one of these individuals and
for this work, the PSF is pleased to present him with the Q2 2019 Community
Service Award:  
*

> RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the Q2 2019 Community
> Service Award to Chris Angelico for his work towards fostering the online
> Python community by helping maintain the pydotorg-www mailing list, helping
> community members get edit access to the public-facing Python wiki, and also
> for being an active contributor to python-ideas mailing list and the python-
> dev mailing list.

* Chris had a very noble reason to start programming: his older brother was
doing it so he had to follow suit! This, along with getting into the family
business of importing and exporting educational materials, led to a lifelong
love of learning and technology. By the 1990’s Chris was working as a
developer and first used Python when he needed to embed a scripting language
in a C++ project. “Python offered a simple, clean, boilerplate-free scripting
language that still had all the power that I needed for that initial project,”
he says. Though the project ended up going in a different direction, Chris was
already hanging out on Python mailing lists and was there to stay.  
  
Since 2012, Chris has been an active contributor to the `python-
dev <https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/python-dev.python.org/>`_ and
`python-ideas <https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/python-
ideas.python.org/>`_ mailing lists, which are a large part of how the Python
language gets developed. python-dev is used by core developers to discuss
release dates and plans that could involve breaking changes to Python. On
python-ideas, topics surround proposals that haven't matured enough to discuss
on python-dev, and contributors can either reject ideas or help to refine them
until they can be seriously proposed. “Both lists have a lot of incredibly
smart people, but also very opinionated people, so it's pretty awesome to hang
out and discuss,” says Chris. “They are significant parts of the funnel that
brings proposals to fruition. Many changes start out with a discussion on
python-ideas, then perhaps a PEP [Python Enhancement Proposal] is written, and
it's discussed at length before migrating to python-dev for detailed
discussion, and then finally code gets written and merged in.”  
  
“Over the years I've known him, he's helped many people with technical
questions.” recalls fellow python-ideas contributor Steve D’Aprano, “he's also
been granted write permissions for the PEP repo, so Chris is the guy to go to
for technical help with writing PEPs and pushing them into the repo.”  
  
In 2015, a dominant topic on python-ideas was the
`f-string <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/>`_, a briefer string format
than was previously available. Those against it said it was not Pythonic, and
those for it said it was more readable than existing options. “The discussion
went back and forth on that one, with many people supporting it intensely, and
many others fighting just as intensely against it,” recalls Chris. F-strings
were added to the Python core library in version 3.6, and you can read the
discussion on python-ideas `here <https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-
ideas/2015-July/034657.html>`_.  
  
A user-maintained repository of all things Python, the `Python
Wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/>`_ holds everything from user guides to
advanced topics in the Python ecosystem. Since 2012 Chris has been an
administrator, making sure contributors are actual humans with honest intent.
“If it weren't for Chris I doubt the wiki would be anywhere near as popular as
it is,” notes `Steve Holden <https://twitter.com/holdenweb>`_, PSF Director
(2004-2013) and creator of the Community Service Award. “His efforts on
python-dev help to keep Python moving forward and I'm happy that Chris'
efforts for the community are being publicly recognised in this way.” More on
how to become a contributor to the Python wiki can be found
`here <https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage#use>`_.  
  
Chris can even thank his work on Python lists for his current job teaching
Python and JavaScript to adult learners at
`Thinkful <https://www.thinkful.com/>`_. “The company head-hunted me based on
the mailing list posts they saw.” Chris recalls, “So if you, too, enjoy coding
and talking about code, hang out, you never know who'll notice you!”  
  
In his free time, he can be found playing and modding video games. He’s a big
fan of Alice in Wonderland, which he frequently uses as an avatar.
