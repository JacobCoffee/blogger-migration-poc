Regional Conference Grants
==========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/07/regional-conference-grants.html>`_.

As part of the ongoing work to make Python conferences more widely accessible,
the PSF Board has awarded grants to two regional conferences to help with
their expenses.

`PyCon PL 2009 <http://liwo.polsl.pl/pycon-pl>`_ is being planned for 16-18
October in Ustroń, Poland. The first PyCon PL last year had 130 attendees and
13 separate talks. With the move to the new location this year, Filip Kłębczyk
and the other organizers are preparing for at least 160 participants and have
added an extra day to allow for more talks. They are also adding a lightning
talks session.

The `pyArkansas 2009 conference <http://pycamp.python.org/Arkansas/HomePage>`_
(pyAR) is planned for November 14th. It will be hosted on the campus of the
University of Central Arkansas in Conway, Arkansas, in the United States. The
one day program includes four tracks covering topics ranging from beginning
programming to Django and Twisted.
