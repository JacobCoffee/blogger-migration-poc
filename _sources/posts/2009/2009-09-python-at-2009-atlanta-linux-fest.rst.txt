Python at the 2009 Atlanta Linux Fest
=====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/09/python-at-2009-atlanta-linux-fest.html>`_.

We should all give Brandon Rhodes a hearty "Thanks!" for doing a great job
representing Python at the `Atlanta Linux Fest <http://atlantalinuxfest.org/>`_
on September 19th. You can read `Brandon's account of the
day <http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/python-at-atlanta-linux-fest/>`_ for
more details and his advice to anyone planning similar outreach activities.
