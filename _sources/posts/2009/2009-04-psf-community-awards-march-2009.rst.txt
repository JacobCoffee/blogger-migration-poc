PSF Community Awards - March 2009
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/04/psf-community-awards-march-2009.html>`_.

_Sunday, March 29th, at Pycon 2009 in Chicago:_ On behalf of the PSF Board of
Directors, Python BDFL and PSF President Guido van Rossum announced two
`Python Software Foundation Community
Awards <http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/>`_.

`PSF Community Awards <http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/>`_ are
given semi-regularly, several times each year, to people who have made
significant contributions to the broader Python community, helping the
Foundation to fulfill its mission. Each prize includes a free PyCon
registration and $500 towards travel and hotel.

This time we recognized two people who have helped to make PyCon possible:

*Mary Rush* has given selflessly for four years now, staffing the
registration desk and providing a friendly face for PyCon.

*Carl Karsten* has been a great asset to PyCon for the last three years. His
energy and enthusiasm have helped PyCon reach new highs.

Congratulations and many thanks to Mary and Carl!
