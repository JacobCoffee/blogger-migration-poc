Online Degree Reviews Joins the PSF as Sponsor Member
=====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/04/online-degree-reviews-joins-psf-as.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is happy to welcome `Online Degree
Reviews <http://www.onlinedegreereviews.org/>`_ as a sponsor member. The Online
Degree Reviews website allows students to review and discuss experiences about
online college degrees. The site is written in Python using the Django web
framework.

Steve Rawlinson gave their reasons for signing up to sponsor the Foundation:

> We'd like to give back to the Python community that made Online Degree
> Reviews possible by using some of the advertising revenues the site
> generates. We hope that our sponsorship of the Python Software Foundation
> will allow developers to focus on what they do best, including continued
> improvements to the language, and support the Python language eco-system.

Becoming a Sponsor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sponsor members pay annual dues to support the Foundation's activities.
Prospective sponsor members apply for membership to the PSF board. The board
verifies that they meet the criteria set out for sponsor members and then
votes on whether to recommend them for sponsor membership in the next
election. For more information about membership in the Python Software
Foundation, refer to the `Membership FAQ <http://python.org/psf/membership/>`_.
