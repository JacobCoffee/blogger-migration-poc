Statistics
^^^^^^^^^^

This has been a growth year for the PSF's involvement in GSoC. We have had the
largest group of applicants and mentors since we began participating in the
program, up about 10% from last year. Students submitted 89 applications, both
for core Python development work and for one of the projects being sponsored
by the PSF. The community has provided 72 mentors to help the students.

Increasing Diversity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PSF is committed to increasing the diversity of the Python community. One
way we have been working toward that goal is by encouraging women and other
minorities to apply to participate in GSoC through one of the PSF-sponsored
projects. This year, three of the 36 accepted applications are from women.
That is an improvement over past years, but we still have work to do to raise
the participation rate further.

What Next?
^^^^^^^^^^

The GSoC program is now in the `Community Bonding
Period <http://googlesummerofcode.blogspot.com/2007/04/so-what-is-this-
community-bonding-all.html>`_. Community members should watch for messages from
the student participants on mailing lists and in other forums, and take the
opportunity to get to know them. This is also a good time to introduce them to
the development tools and processes, and answer questions about how patches
are reviewed and approved or how best to communicate with other team members.

For more details about the schedule, see the `GSoC
timeline <http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline>`_
on the project web site.
