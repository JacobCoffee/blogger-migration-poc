PSF Members Meeting to be held at PyCon 2011
============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/02/psf-members-meeting-to-be-held-at-pycon.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation will hold a meeting for current and nominated
members on March 11, 2011, from 12:30 pm to 1:20 pm local, in Atlanta,
Georgia, USA at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta hotel.

Agenda
^^^^^^

The agenda for the meeting is still being set. It includes time for newly
nominated members to introduce themselves, and for members running for the
Board of Directors to present their positions. If you have another topic you
would like added to the agenda, please contact PSF Secretary Pat Campbell
before the meeting.

Elections
^^^^^^^^^

In the past, participants at the meeting elected the new board, approved new
members of the foundation, and conducted other voting in person. However, last
year the PSF switched to an online voting system. That system will be used
again this year, with the ballots being sent out on Friday, March 25, 2011.

Proposals that need to be voted on by the PSF membership should be submitted
in the form of resolutions. Initial discussions on the members mailing list is
encouraged to craft the language for the resolution.

The deadline for nomination of new members and proposal of resolutions to be
voted on by the membership is Tuesday, March 22.

Call for Nominations of Directors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please nominate candidates for the PSF Board of Directors by sending email to
the PSF Board. Self-nominations are welcome. Current directors should also
indicate whether they will stand for election again. Candidates should `post
brief bios and position statements in the PSF
wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2011>`_.

Call for New Member Nominations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New members are nominated to the PSF by current members. To nominate a regular
member, first confirm that they are interested in taking on the
responsibility, and then post your nomination to the members mailing list.

The prospective member must also complete and submit a `membership application
form <http://www.python.org/psf/forms/application/>`_. See the `PSF Membership
FAQ <http://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_ for details
