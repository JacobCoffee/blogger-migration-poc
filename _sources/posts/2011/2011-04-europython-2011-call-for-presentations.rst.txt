EuroPython 2011 Call for Presentations
======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/04/europython-2011-call-for-presentations.html>`_.

The EuroPython 2011 organizers are accepting proposals for talks. They are
looking for presentations on every aspect of Python, including programming
from novice to advanced levels, applications and frameworks, and how you have
been involved in introducing Python into your organisation.

The `deadline for submissions <http://ep2011.europython.eu/call-for-papers>`_ is
April 6th.

EuroPython
^^^^^^^^^^

`EuroPython <http://ep2011.europython.eu/>`_ is the official European conference
about the Python programming language. The conference is being held June 20–26
in Florence, Italy, at the Mediterraneo Conference Centre, situated near the
heart of Florence’s old city centre.

Presenting at EuroPython
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The organizers will accept a broad range of presentations, from reports on
academic and commercial projects to tutorials and case studies. As long as the
presentation is interesting and potentially useful to the Python community, it
will be considered for the program.

_First-time speakers are especially welcome._

For more details about how to submit a proposal, refer to the official `call
for presentations <http://ep2011.europython.eu/call-for-papers>`_ on the
`EuroPython <http://ep2011.europython.eu/>`_ website.
