This is the second Python conference held in Dublin, Ireland. The event brings
together the Python community for a weekend of talks, tutorials, workshops and
sprints.

enthusiastic Pythonistas based in Dublin, a community effort for the
community.

Whether you're a lad or a lass, now is a good time to book your trip to
verdant Ireland.
