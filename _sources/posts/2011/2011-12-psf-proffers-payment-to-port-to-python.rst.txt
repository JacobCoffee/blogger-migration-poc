PSF Proffers Payment to Port to Python 3
========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/12/psf-proffers-payment-to-port-to-python.html>`_.

As news of Python 3 porting becomes a more frequent occurrence and Python 3.3
development takes strides towards becoming the version everyone wants, the PSF
has their own way of helping: money. With a `grant
program <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_ in place, the PSF is awarding
funds to projects that plan an effort to port their work to Python 3.

As we've previously written about, R. David Murray's work to `port the email
package <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/04/psf-grant-funds-porting-work-for-
email.html>`_ was funded by a PSF grant. Jean-Paul Calderone took advantage of a
grant `to port
PyOpenSSL <http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/browse_thread/thread/3675e342b40310e9/157ae91ccee19151?show_docid=157ae91ccee19151>`_.
Most recently, Chris McDonough used grant funding `to port
WebOb <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/09/psf-provides-grant-to-port-
webob.html>`_ to Python 3. The foundation has been able to help these projects
make the move to Python 3 and hopes to help even more in the coming year.

As PSF Director Jesse Noller states on <http://www.getpython3.com>, "The
Python Software Foundation is here for not just CPython, or python-core, or
python the language. It is here for Python -- the community, its efforts, its
developers, designers and people." These grants are being made available for
the betterment of the Python community, and funding can be used in any number
of ways to get the job done. For some self-employed developers, funding may
mean that porting a project could become more than a side-project. For
projects with multiple developers, funding could mean a series of team sprints
to complete the work. This could even be used in conjunction with funding from
the `PSF Sprint committee <http://www.pythonsprints.com>`_.

If you're involved in a project which could benefit from funding to complete a
Python 3 port, Jesse Noller has `recently written on the
topic <http://jessenoller.com/2011/12/09/porting-to-python-3-an-offer-for-
you/>`_ and offers his services to assist with grant applications. From
templates to reviews, he is willing to step up and help represent projects
before the PSF board for approval.
