Google Summer of Code: Call for Projects and Mentors
====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/google-summer-of-code-call-for-projects.html>`_.

Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has been sponsoring Google Summer
of Code (GSoC) projects to pair students with mentors from Python-based
projects for real-world development experience. We are pleased to announce
that the PSF is a GSoC sponsoring organization again for 2011!

Call for Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PSF is accepting proposals from different projects in the Python
ecosystem. In order to qualify for PSF sponsorship, projects must be prepared
to provide at least three mentors to act as guides for students over the
course of the summer. Projects also need a well-defined method of team
communication, such as a mailing list or dedicated IRC channel.

In addition to the mentors from the core Python team, several umbrella teams
are already involved with the PSF for GSoC. They include:

  * `Mailman <http://www.list.org/>`_
  * `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_
  * `Pyjamas <http://pyjs.org/>`_
  * `PyLint <http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint>`_
  * `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_
  * `PySoy <http://www.pysoy.org/>`_
  * `Tryton <http://www.tryton.org/en/>`_

The number of student positions available for PSF projects is based on the
number of project applications received during this phase of the program. So
if your project could benefit from participating in GSoC, submit `an
application <https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHh3WFNGYzkyWWE0ZjM1eFFoUUVGWmc6MQ>`_!

Students
^^^^^^^^

Currently, the PSF is _only_ accepting proposals from different projects in
the Python ecosystem. However, it is never too early for students to be
involved!

Students may submit to their GSoC application to the PSF from March 28th -
April 8th. Please see the `GSoC
timeline <http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline>`_
for the complete program schedule. We encourage students to find a project
they are interested in working with _before_ the application period opens.
Sending an inquiry to the project's mailing list asking where help is needed
is _highly_ recommended.
