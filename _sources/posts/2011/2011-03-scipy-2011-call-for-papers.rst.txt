SciPy 2011: Call for Papers
===========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/scipy-2011-call-for-papers.html>`_.

`SciPy 2011 <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011/>`_, the 10th Python in
Science conference, will be held July 11 - 16, 2011, in Austin, TX.

At this conference, novel applications and breakthroughs made in the pursuit
of science using Python are presented. The conference is preceded by two days
of tutorials, during which community experts provide training on several
scientific Python packages.

Potential speakers are invited to take part by submitting a talk abstract at
the `conference website <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2011/papers.php>`_.
Associated papers (optional) are included in the peer-reviewed conference
proceedings, to be published online.

This year will also feature two specialized tracks, whose express aim it is to
open up SciPy to the broader Python community. The first track is *Python in
Data Science* chaired by Peter Wang, and the second is entitled *Python and
Core Technologies* chaired by Anthony Scopatz.
