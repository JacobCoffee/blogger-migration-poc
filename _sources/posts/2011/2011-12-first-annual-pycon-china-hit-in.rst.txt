First annual PyCon China a hit in Shanghai
==========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/12/first-annual-pycon-china-hit-in.html>`_.

The first annual `PyCon China <http://cn.pycon.org/2011/>`_ recently wrapped up
an excellent event in Shanghai, with the December 3 and 4 conference serving
over 450 attendees and just under 500 viewers of their live webcast. The new
conference drew so much interest that over 100 people were put on a waiting
list to get in.

The conference schedule included 25 topics with 13 of them being 45+ minute
presentations. After a keynote speech by Sting Chen titled "Python Enriches
the World", the conference went on to cover
`Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_, the `Xunlei <http://www.xunlei.com/>`_
download manager, `OpenStack <http://openstack.org/>`_, and others. They also
included a lightning talk series with twelve 10-15 minute sessions. As with
many other PyCons around the world, video of each talk is available
`online <http://topgeek.org/?p=335>`_.
