Bring the Superbowl of Python to Your Hometown
==============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/bring-superbowl-of-python-to-your.html>`_.

The site for PyCon 2014 and 2015 has not been set, yet. If you want your city
to be considered, attend the Site Selection Meeting in the *Dunwoody room*
at PyCon 2011 during the *Sunday lunch break*. Tell us why _your_ city
should be the next host of the premier Python conference in North America.
