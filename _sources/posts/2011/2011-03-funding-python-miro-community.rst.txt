Funding the Python Miro Community
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/funding-python-miro-community.html>`_.

A year ago `Will Kahn-Greene <http://bluesock.org/%7Ewillg/>`_ started the
`Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`_, a web-site that
indexes Python-related videos regardless of where those videos exist on the
Internet. The PSF has provided US$1,800 to finance continuation of this work,
including US$900 for one year of `Miro Community <http://mirocommunity.org/>`_
service costs. The remainder of the grant will go toward further development
of the Python Miro Community.  

Miro Community
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Miro Community <http://mirocommunity.org/>`_ offers an easy way to collect
and curate videos already on the internet. It is one of several projects of
the non-profit organization `Participatory Culture
Foundation <http://pculture.org/>`_ all centered around supporting distribution
of video content on the Internet. Among these is `Universal
Subtitles <http://universalsubtitles.org/>`_, a toolset and community to add
subtitles to any web video.  
The `Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`_ indexes Python-
related videos from many separate hosting sites on the Internet. The
collection includes metadata for the videos to make them searchable and more
useful to people. The site currently holds around 550 videos, covering a wide
variety of Python-related topics from Python user groups, Python-related
conferences like PyCon, and other sources.

Funding usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

US$900 of the grant will go towards Miro Community service costs as PCF rolls
out Miro Community 1.2, which has a tiered service plan. The other US$900 of
the grant will go towards improvements to `Python Miro
Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`_:  

  * integrate `Universal Subtitles <http://universalsubtitles.org/>`_ into the site
  * fixing `Miro Community <http://mirocommunity.org/>`_ software to allow transcriptions to be part of the search corpus
  * fixing `Miro Community <http://mirocommunity.org/>`_ software to allow for automated data validation
