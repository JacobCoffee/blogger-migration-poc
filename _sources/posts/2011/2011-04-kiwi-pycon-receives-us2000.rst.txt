Kiwi PyCon Receives US$2000
===========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/04/kiwi-pycon-receives-us2000.html>`_.

The 2011 Kiwi Python Conference was awarded a US$2,000 grant from the Python
Software Foundation during the latter's March board meeting. Kiwi PyCon is the
premier Python Conference of New Zealand and will by held in Wellington from
August 27th through the 28th. It is organized by the New Zealand Python Users
Group (NZPUG). You can `register <http://nz.pycon.org/>`_ now to make sure your
spot is reserved. The organizers are currently looking for proposals for talks
on all aspects of Python, so you have an opportunity to get involved and
submit a talk. Now is a good time for you to take that trip to New Zealand
that you have always wanted!
