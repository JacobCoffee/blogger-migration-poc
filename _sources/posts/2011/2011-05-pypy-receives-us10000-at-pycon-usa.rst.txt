The `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_ Project received US$10,000 from the Python
Software Foundation at the 2011 USA Python Conference in recognition for the
speed with which the project has matured. Jesse Noller officiated, and gave
them the check on behalf of the PSF. You can read their response on the `PyPy
status blog <http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/03/thank-you-to-psf.html>`_. We
would like to congratulate them on their success and wish them well!
