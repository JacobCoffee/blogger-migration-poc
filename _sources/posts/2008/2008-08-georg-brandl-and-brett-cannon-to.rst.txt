Georg Brandl and Brett Cannon to Receive PSF Community Awards
=============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/08/georg-brandl-and-brett-cannon-to.html>`_.

At the July Board meeting of the PSF Board of Directors, `PSF Community
Awards <http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/>`_ were awarded to
Georg Brandl and Brett Cannon.

Georg has been an enthusiastic contributor to the core for several years, and
a while ago stunned the Python development world by building `the Sphinx
documentation system <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ as an alternative to the
LaTeX-based system we had been using previously, and converting `the Python
documentation <http://docs.python.org/dev/>`_ to use it.

Brett has also been an active core developer for many years, but was nominated
for his infrastructure work in migrating `the Python bug-tracking
system <http://bugs.python.org/>`_ off of SourceForge to our own Roundup
instance, and for his efforts keeping `the Python developer
introduction <http://www.python.org/dev/intro/>`_ updated.

Georg and Brett richly deserve recognition for their contributions.
Congratulations to Brett and Georg, and thanks for all your hard work!
