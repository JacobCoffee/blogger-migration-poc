Two upcoming development events: Jython sprint, and Python bug day
==================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/02/two-upcoming-development-events-jython.html>`_.

Two upcoming events provide a good opportunity to jump into Jython or Python
development.

First, there's `a Jython sprint <http://jython.eventwax.com/jython-sprint>`_
being held in San Francisco on Saturday, February 16th. The sprinters are
concentrating on tasks for Jython 2.5, following the newly updated `Jython
road map <http://wiki.python.org/jython/RoadMap>`_.

A week later on Saturday February 23rd, we're holding an online `Python Bug
Day <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBugDay>`_. Participants will meet in the
python-dev channel on IRC, and look at open bugs and patches in `Python's bug
=============================================================================
tracker <http://bugs.python.org>`_. Last month's bug day closed 37 issues; will
we do even better this month?
