Help Needed with Python Job Board
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/02/help-needed-with-python-job-board.html>`_.

One of the more valuable services available through the
`python.org <http://python.org/>`_ web site is the `Python Job
Board <http://www.python.org/community/jobs/>`_. This is normally maintained by
the pydotorg webmasters, but they have been too busy with their day jobs
recently and so we have a backlog of almost a month's worth of jobs. If you
are an employer wondering when your posting is going to appear, please accept
our apologies. The Job Board, like the rest of the Python Software Foundation,
is staffed by volunteers, and so things can't always happen as promptly as we
would like. If you are someone who is interested in joining the python.org
maintenance team I am sure our regular maintainers would be glad of the
opportunity to shed a little of the burden. The Job Board is a fairly easy way
to move into site maintenance, and we are always looking for help. If you can
spare some time and want to help the Python community (as well as seeing the
jobs before anyone else) please send an email to pydotorg at python.org to
find out more about what's involved.
