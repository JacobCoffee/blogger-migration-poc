PyCon FR: May 17/18, 2008
=========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/05/pycon-fr-may-1718-2008.html>`_.

PyCon FR is to be held at the `Cité des sciences et de la
Villette <http://fr.pycon.org/presentation>`_ in Paris. This is the second
national Python Conference in France. There is an interesting and varied
program, which you can see in English `on Tarek Ziadé's
blog <http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/pycon-fr-is-coming-up-ask-
the-program>`_. We wish our French cousins bonne chance and look forward to
seeing the sessions written up by enthusiastic delegates.
