PSF Board Election Dates for 2022
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/06/psf-board-election-dates-for-2022.html>`_.

Board elections are a chance for the community to help us find the next batch
of folks to help us steer the PSF. This year there are 4 seats open on the PSF
board. You can see who is on the board currently
`here <https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/history/>`_. (Kushal, Jannis,
Lorena and Marlene are at the end of their current terms.) Nominations for new
board members opens today!

  

Timeline:

  * Nominations are open, Wednesday, June 1st 12:00 PM Eastern
  * Board Director Nomination cut-off: Wednesday, June 15, 2022 AoE
  * Voter application cut-off date: Wednesday, June 15, 2022 AoE
  * Announce candidates: Thursday, June 16th
  * Voting start date: Monday, June 20, 2022 AoE
  * Voting end date: Friday, June 30, 2022 AoE

Nominations should be made through `this
form <https://www.python.org/nominations/2022-python-software-foundation-
board/create/>`_ (Note: you will need to sign into or create your python.org
user account first). You can nominate yourself or someone else, but no one
will be forced to run, so you may want to consider reaching out to someone
before nominating them.  

  

You need to be a contributing, managing, supporting, or fellow member by June
15th to vote in this election. Learn more about membership
`here <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_ or if you have questions about
