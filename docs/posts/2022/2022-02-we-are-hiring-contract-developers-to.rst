We are hiring contract developers to build new features in PyPI
===============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/02/we-are-hiring-contract-developers-to.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation has funding available for designing, developing
and deploying organization accounts in PyPI.

  

PyPI is the official repository of Python packages. PyPI allows users to
search for packages, publish and distribute packages.The aim of this project
is to allow PyPI users to set up an organization account, invite other users
to join, organize those users into teams, and manage ownership and permissions
across multiple projects. We hope to provide organization accounts as a paid
service to companies and complimentary access to community projects. The
organization account feature will provide the structure based on which new
features can be offered to paying customers.You can read `this
post <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/12/pypi-user-feedback-summary.html>`_
that summarizes the user surveys.

  

We hope to hire two contractors who will code, test, review, document and
deploy the organization account features. The two contractors include one
backend developer and one frontend developer.

We expect both roles to start by early April. Both roles can be done remotely.
Each working week consists of 35 hours. Each milestone is applicable to the
backend and frontend developer roles.

  

What is an RfP period?

  

A Request for Proposals (RfP) is a process intended to allow us (the Python
Software Foundation) to collect proposals from potential contractors and
select contractor(s) best suited to fulfill the specified work.

After the RfP period closes we will evaluate the received proposals based on
the `evaluation criteria <https://github.com/psf/request-
for/blob/main/2022-PyPI/RFP.md#evaluation-criteria>`_, seek clarification from
proposers as necessary, and select one or more contractors to complete the
work specified in the `scope section <https://github.com/psf/request-
for/blob/main/2022-PyPI/RFP.md#scope>`_.

Note: This Request For Proposal document may be updated to reflect things that
we learn during the process. The canonical version and history is available
`here <https://github.com/psf/request-for/blob/main/2022-PyPI/RFP.md>`_.

How do I submit a proposal?

  

Please read the `RfP <https://github.com/psf/request-
for/blob/main/2022-PyPI/RFP.md>`_ to know how to submit a proposal, the
evaluation criteria and the scope of the roles.
