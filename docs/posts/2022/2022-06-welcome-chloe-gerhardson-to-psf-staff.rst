Chloe Gerhardson - PSF Infrastructure Engineer  
  
As a recent graduate of Springfield Technical Community College’s associates
program in Computer Programming, Chloe will be growing into a role that
supports the wide gamut of software technologies that facilitate the technical
aspects of our community.

In time Chloe will share in all responsibilities of the Infrastructure Team
and help the PSF move its infrastructure commitment to the community from a
reactive and maintenance stance towards progress on new and expanded services
to fulfill our mission.

In her own words…

> I am thrilled and grateful to be brought along in the journey of growing and
> maintaining the PSF’s infrastructure, and I look forward to working with the
> PSF’s incredible staff members, as well as our wonderful community members
> at large.

Although excitement abounds for the learning, growing, and doing that this
role requires Chloe also stays busy as a committed, registered, and active
Registered Yoga Teacher in her community, skateboarder, dog lover, traveler,
and aficionado of live music.

Please join us in welcoming Chloe!
