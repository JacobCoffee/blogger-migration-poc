We are hiring to expand our Infrastructure staff!
=================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/03/we-are-hiring-to-expand-our.html>`_.

On behalf of the Python Software Foundation, and with much excitement as the
hiring manager, I am elated to announce that we are hiring for a full-time
position to double the PSF staff dedicated to our Infrastructure... from one
to two.

  

The job listing is `live on the
python.org <https://www.python.org/jobs/6261/>`_, and you can find details about
the position there. But I wanted to take this opportunity to talk about what
fulfilling it will mean for the PSF as an organization and the Python
community at large.

  

This year will mark four years since I joined the PSF full-time as Director of
Infrastructure after many years volunteering to support the infrastructure. I
hope that the impact I have had in this time on stability and availability has
been noticed, but must admit that the breadth of concerns has been limiting to
our ability to be effective in improvements and expansion.

  

With the addition of a new member of the team I look forward to the
opportunity for us to increasingly move the infrastructure forward, provide
new features and services to the community, and better fulfill our mission.
I'd be lying if I didn't say I was excited to more easily take time off as
well.

  

As I look forward to some of the `exciting
things <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/12/pypi-user-feedback-summary.html>`_
in store for PyPI and consider the opportunities for the PSF Infrastructure to
serve more of the community in more ways, I can't wait to work with you now or
maybe next time we hire to expand this team.
