Third-Quarter Community Service Awards
======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/10/third-quarter-community-service-awards.html>`_.

Regular readers will know that the Foundation periodically honors those who
have made significant contributions to its mission. Often these people aren't
even members of the Foundation, but this doesn't exclude them. At its recent
meeting the PSF Board voted Community Awards to two people, one of whom isn't
currently a member.

Noufal Ibrahim Noufal was nominated for heading up the organizing team for the
recent (and very successful) first `PyCon India <http://in.pycon.org/>`_
conference held on September 26 and 27 in Bangalore, attracting 450 delegates.
Although Noufal was "first among equals" this award also recognizes the work
of everyone who helped to make the inaugural conference so successful.

Barry Warsaw Many people are unaware of the huge volume of mail that is
processed by software written in Python every hour of every day. This is
because they don't know about the `Mailman project <http://www.list.org/>`_,
which was Barry's brainchild. Barry, a founder member of the Foundation, also
acted as release manager for several recent Python releases.

The Foundation is grateful to Noufal and Barry for their efforts, each of
which helps to promote Python's popularity and increase the Python community
as a whole.
