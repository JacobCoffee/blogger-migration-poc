Second-Quarter Community Service Awards
=======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/06/second-quarter-community-service-awards.html>`_.

The Foundation tries to recognize those whose assistance has been significant
in its growth and development as well as its day-to-day operations. This
quarter's Community Service Award winners are two particularly noteworthy
examples.

*Stephan Deibel* Stephan was last year's outgoing chairman after four years
in harness. This year Stephan has stepped down as a director, after helping to
ensure that the Foundation's bylaws were reorganized. Stephan developed
pythonology.com to promote Python, and his work as founder of
`Wingware <http://wingware.com/>`_ and a developer of the Wing IDE has also had
a significant impact.

Sean Reifschneider Sean has master-minded the PyCOn networking every time it's
worked, and without the support of this always helpful and reliably competent
`tummy.com <http://tummy.com/>`_ director our conferences simply would not have
been the same.

Our thanks and congratulations go to both these recipients.
