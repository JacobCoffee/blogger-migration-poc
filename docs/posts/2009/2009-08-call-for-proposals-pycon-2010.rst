Call for proposals -- PyCon 2010
================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/08/call-for-proposals-pycon-2010.html>`_.

*Submission Due date: October 1st, 2009*

Want to showcase your skills as a Python Hacker? Want to have hundreds of
people see your talk on the subject of your choice? Have some hot button issue
you think the community needs to address, or have some package, code or
project you simply love talking about? Want to launch your master plan to take
over the world with python?

> PyCon is your platform for getting the word out and teaching something new
> to hundreds of people, face to face.

Previous PyCon conferences have had a broad range of presentations, from
reports on academic and commercial projects, tutorials on a broad range of
subjects and case studies. All conference speakers are volunteers and come
from a myriad of backgrounds. Some are new speakers, some are old speakers.
Everyone is welcome so bring your passion and your code! We're looking to you
to help us top the previous years of success PyCon has had.

PyCon 2010 is looking for proposals to fill the formal presentation tracks.
The PyCon conference days will be February 19-22, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia,
preceded by the tutorial days (February 17-18), and followed by four days of
development sprints (February 22-25).

Online proposal submission is open now! Proposals will be accepted through
October 1st, with acceptance notifications coming out on November 15th. For
the detailed call for proposals, please see the `submission information on the
PyCon site <http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/proposals/>`_.

For more details about the conference, see `the main
site. <http://us.pycon.org/2010/>`_ Videos of talks from previous years are
available on <http://pycon.blip.tv>

We look forward to seeing you in Atlanta!
