In Search of Success Stories
============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/08/in-search-of-success-stories.html>`_.

The PSF is looking for information about successful uses of Python in order to
create an updated list of success stories and find organizations that might be
interested in sponsoring activities for the community. If you know of a
company that uses Python for any purpose, please take a few minutes to answer
the questions on our `short
survey <http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHlwaUxIY2g0ZXpUMk4tREZDSTY3bkE6MA..>`_.
You don't have to work at an organization to tell us about how they use
Python! Don't worry about duplicates, either, we'll take care of them once we
have all of the data collected.

The answers to this survey will be kept private. If you still don't want to
identify yourself, no problem! We just want to know where Python is being
used, so
`responding <http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHlwaUxIY2g0ZXpUMk4tREZDSTY3bkE6MA..>`_
still helps us out.

If (and only if) you decide to include contact information *and* you give
the PSF permission, we may use the contacts provided to find sponsors for the
PSF and Python-related events (PyCon, EuroPython, DjangoCon, etc).

_Individual answers from this survey will never be published._

`So please, take the survey
now! <http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHlwaUxIY2g0ZXpUMk4tREZDSTY3bkE6MA..>`_
