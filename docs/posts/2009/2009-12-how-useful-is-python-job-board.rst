How Useful is the Python Job Board?
===================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/12/how-useful-is-python-job-board.html>`_.

A service that the PSF has run for a very long time now is the `Python Job
Board <http://www.python.org/community/jobs/>`_. This allows any potential
employer with a requirement for Python skills to post a free advertisement.
The service is free because it is primarily intended to benefit Python
community members. Employers are encouraged, but not required, to contribute
to the Foundation.

So what I'd like to know is this: how useful is that service? If you have ever
found the Job Board helpful, as either employee or employer, or even just to
keep an eye on the Python employment market, please post a brief comment here
letting us know what the Board did for you.

Employers and agents: please `read this
page <http://www.python.org/community/jobs/howto/>`_ before submitting jobs: the
Board is run by volunteers, and you can make their task easier.
