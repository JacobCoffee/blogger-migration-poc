Associate Memberships
=====================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/07/associate-memberships.html>`_.

Following discussions at EuroPython there has been some talk about the
possibility of introducing associate memberships. At present nobody is really
clear exactly what such a package would comprise, but it's likely that there'd
be a mailing list, a quarterly (printed, snail-mailed) newsletter and perhaps
other benefits.

Current evidence is that many people would like to support Python and the
Foundation's mission by paying for such an associate membership, and it could
also be seen as a "starter grade" for those with ambitions to eventually
become full members.

What do you think a PSF Associate Membership should provide, and what should
the obligations of membership be (if any)?
