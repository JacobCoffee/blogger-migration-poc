What modules need documentation work for Python 3.x?
====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/09/what-modules-need-documentation-work.html>`_.

As part of ongoing preparations for GHOP, Titus Brown and the other organizers
are soliciting feedback about what modules in the standard library need more
documentation work.

Are there any modules that lack useful examples? Or where the writing or
examples could be clarified?

Head over to `this survey <http://moderator.appspot.com/#e=c8727>`_ and give us
your opinion *today* , or forever hold your tongue!
