Buildbot Champion Needed
========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2009/09/buildbot-champion-needed.html>`_.

The Python buildbots have been switched off. The reason for this is that there
is nobody to manage them, and configuration changes would be required (along
with continuous management) for the buildbots to be restarted.

If you'd like to help Python's continuous integration process, please drop an
email to pydotorg at python dot org.

EDIT: the buildbots referred to are the community buildbots used to run tests
for specific projects. The primary need is for people to donate, and actively
manage, build slaves.
