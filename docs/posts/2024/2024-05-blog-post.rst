Thinking about running for the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors? Let’s talk!
=========================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/blog-post.html>`_.

PSF Board elections are a chance for the community to choose representatives
to help the PSF create a vision for and build the future of the Python
community. This year there are 3 seats open on the PSF board. Check out who is
currently on the `PSF Board <https://www.python.org/psf/board/>`_. (Débora
Azevedo, Kwon-Han Bae, and Tania Allard are at the end of their current
terms.)

Office Hours Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This year, the PSF Board is running Office Hours so you can connect with
current members to ask questions and learn more about what being a part of the
Board entails. There will be two Office Hour sessions:  

  * June 11th, 4 PM UTC  

  * June 18th, 12 PM UTC

Make sure to `check what time <https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter>`_ that
is for you. We welcome you to join the `PSF
Discord <https://discord.gg/4Hm36PPgpG>`_ and navigate to the #psf-elections
channel to participate in Office Hours. The server is moderated by PSF Staff
and locked between office hours sessions. If you’re new to Discord, check out
some `Discord Basics <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-
us/sections/360008206871-Discord-Basics>`_ to help you get started.  

Who runs for the Board?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People who care about the Python community, who want to see it flourish and
grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend regular meetings, serve on
committees, participate in conversations, and promote the Python community.
Check out our `Life as Python Software Foundation Director
video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M>`_ to learn more about what
being a part of the PSF Board entails. We also invite you to review our
`Annual Impact Report for 2023 <https://www.python.org/psf/annual-
report/2023/>`_ to learn more about the PSF mission and what we do.  

Nomination info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can nominate yourself or someone else. We encourage you to reach out to
people before you nominate them to ensure they are enthusiastic about the
potential of joining the Board. Nominations open on Tuesday, June 11th, 2:00
PM UTC, so you have a few weeks to research the role and craft a nomination
statement. The nomination period ends on June 25th, 2:00 PM UTC.
