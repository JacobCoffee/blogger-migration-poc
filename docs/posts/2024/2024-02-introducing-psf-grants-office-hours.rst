Introducing PSF Grants Program Office Hours
===========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html>`_.

In October 2023, `we acknowledged the situation surrounding DjangoCon
Africa <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/10/september-october-board-
votes.html>`_ and noted our intent to make ongoing improvements to the Grants
Program. We also recognize that we are in a new world of hybrid programming
since the onset of the pandemic which comes with different funding and cost
challenges. One step we are taking to refresh the Grants Program (we’ll be
reporting on other steps soon) is to establish PSF Grants Program Office
Hours.  
  
The office hours will be hosted on the `Python Software Foundation
Discord <https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe>`_ once a month at 1-2PM UTC (9AM
Eastern) on the third Tuesday of the month. (Check `what
time <https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter>`_ that is for you.) We invite the
Python community to join in to receive support for Grant-related questions and
inquiries! If you have urgent or immediate questions related to the Grants
Program, please email grants@pyfound.org.

Direct line of communication
----------------------------

As we sat down to address the challenges and issues raised around the Grants
Program and how to better support the Python community, we came to realize
that refreshing the program would not be an easy and quick task. We need a
two-way communication channel dedicated to the topic of grants with the PSF
Board, the Grants Working Group, the D&I Working Group, the Code of Conduct
Working Group, and most importantly, our vibrant and diverse community.  
  
We believe a direct line of communication between the PSF and the worldwide
Python community is the best first step. In order to create that direct line,
gather your feedback, and collaborate on the future of the program, we are
establishing regular PSF Grants Program Office Hours!  

What’s the goal?
----------------

There are a couple of goals we hope to accomplish with the Grants Program
Office Hours. In the short term, we believe recurring time supporting
communication between the community and the PSF is key. In other words, a
place for folks to come with questions and ideas regarding the Grants Program,
with an understanding that we don’t have it perfect yet. If we have the
answer, or we can point you to the right resource - amazing! If we don’t,
that’s an area we know needs more work and will be added to our “To Do.”  
  
We hope to see the office hours evolve over time as we work through feedback
and make updates to our process, documentation, and resources. In the long
term, the PSF hopes Grants Program Office Hours will create a place for our
community to ask questions about the Grants Program and for us to have
(almost) all the answers. We’d like the office hours to continue to be a place
where we receive feedback from the community and continuously improve what we
can do for Pythonistas around the world.  

PSF Grants Program Office Hour Hosts
------------------------------------

The PSF Grants Program Office Hours will be hosted by members of the `PSF
Staff <https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/>`_. This will change over time,
but for now you can expect to see Laura Graves, Senior Accountant, and Marie
Nordin, Community Communications Manager, hosting the sessions. When needed,
other PSF staff members will sub in for Laura and Marie.  

This sounds great! How can I join?
----------------------------------

The PSF Grants Program Office Hours will be a text-only chat based office hour
hosted on the `Python Software Foundation
Discord <https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe>`_ at 1-2PM UTC (9AM Eastern) on the
third Tuesday of the month. The server is moderated by PSF Staff and is locked
in between office hour sessions. If you’re new to Discord, check out some
`Discord Basics <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-
us/sections/360008206871-Discord-Basics>`_ to help you get started. And as
always, if you have urgent or immediate questions related to the Grants
Program, please email grants@pyfound.org.  
  
Come prepared to the Office Hours with questions and shareable links to your
Grant applications drafts in progress via Google docs, etherpad, pastebin,
etc. We hope to see you there!
