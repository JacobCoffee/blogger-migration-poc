DjangoCon Africa Grant Process Retrospective
============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/03/djangocon-africa-grant-process.html>`_.

The PSF received an `open
letter <https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-
software_5.html>`_ asking us, amongst other things, to look into some of our
recent grant decisions and make recommendations to the PSF Board for improving
the Grants Program. We contracted Carol Willing, of `Willing
Consulting <https://www.willingconsulting.com/>`_, to do this work in the form
of a retrospective. Carolâ€™s scope included reading through mailing lists,
examining Board and Grants Working group norms, creating a comprehensive
timeline, conducting interviews, documenting findings, and offering
recommendations for the future.  
  
In the retrospective Willing contextualizes the PSF Grants Program as part of
the work of a non-profit with a charitable mission, incorporating research on
best practices and effective governance. The full text of the `DjangoCon
Africa Grant Process
Retrospective <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jaCn3mxpmLx1sw83UiCJuB_0tL6G95Qz/view?usp=sharing>`_
is now available.  We are eager to explore the suggestions made in the
retrospective and respond to community feedback.  
  



This retrospective is just one step in our process to ensure the `PSF Grants
Program <https://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_ is responsive, transparent, and
more approachable. We also recently started hosting `PSF Grants Program Office
Hours <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-
hours.html>`_. The office hours are a text-only chat-based session hosted on the
`Python Software Foundation Discord <https://discord.gg/D56fUZTuVb>`_ at 1-2PM
UTC (9AM Eastern) on the third Tuesday of the month. (Check `what
time <https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter>`_ that is for you.)  We look
forward to sharing more of our progress as we continue to enhance and improve
the PSF Grants Program.
