It’s time to cast your vote! Voting is open starting today Tuesday, July 2nd,

How to Vote
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are a voting member of the PSF that affirmed your intention to
participate in this year’s election, you will receive an email from “OpaVote
Voting Link <noreply@opavote.com>” with a link to your ballot. The subject
line will read “Python Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2024”.
If you haven’t seen your ballot by Wednesday, please check your spam folder
for a message from “noreply@opavote.com”. If you don’t see anything get in
touch by emailing psf-elections@python.org so we can look into your account
and make sure we have the most up-to-date email for you.

  
Three seats on the board are open, but you can approve as many of the 19
candidates as you like. We’re delighted by how many of you are willing to
contribute to the Python community by serving on the PSF Board! Make sure you
take some time to look at all `the nominee
statements <https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2024-python-software-
foundation-board/nominees/>`_ and choose your candidates carefully. ATTN: Choose
carefully before you press the *big green vote button*. Once your vote is
cast, it cannot be changed.
