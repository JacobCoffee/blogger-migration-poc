Voting

You must be a contributing, managing, supporting, or fellow member by June
25th to vote in this election. Check out the `PSF membership
page <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_ to learn more about membership
classes and benefits. If you have questions about membership or nominations
please email psf-elections@pyfound.org

Run for the Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Who runs for the board? People who care about the Python community, who want
to see it flourish and grow, and also have a few hours a month to attend
regular meetings, serve on committees, participate in conversations, and
promote the Python community. Check out our `Life as Python Software
Foundation Director video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKj6FaQA4M>`_ to
learn more about what being a part of the PSF Board entails. We also invite
you to review our `Annual Impact Report for
2023 <https://www.python.org/psf/annual-report/2023/>`_ to learn more about the
PSF mission and what we do.  
  
You can nominate yourself or someone else. We would encourage you to reach out
to folks before you nominate them to make sure they are enthusiastic about the
potential of joining the Board. Nominations open on Tuesday, June 11th, 2:00
pm UTC, so you have a few weeks to research the role and craft a nomination
statement.
