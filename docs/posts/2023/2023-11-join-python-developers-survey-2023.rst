Join the Python Developers Survey 2023: Share and learn about the community!
============================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/11/join-python-developers-survey-2023.html>`_.



 This year we are conducting the seventh iteration of the official Python
Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language
and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, we can
identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community
and the key insights into it.  


We encourage you to contribute to our community’s knowledge by sharing your
experience and perspective. Your participation is valued! The survey should
only take you about 10-15 minutes to complete.
