Announcing Our New Security Developer in Residence!
===================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/06/announcing-our-new-security-developer.html>`_.

We `announced our intention <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/01/the-psf-is-
hiring-security-developer-in.html>`_ to fill this role back in January, and
after a thorough search, we have chosen `Seth Michael
Larson <https://github.com/sethmlarson>`_! He joins the PSF for the next year as
our first ever Security Developer-in-Residence. Seth is already well-known to
the Python community – he was named a PSF Fellow last year and has already
written a lot about Python and security on `his
blog <https://sethmlarson.dev/blog>`_.  

This critical role would not be possible without funding from the OpenSSF
`Alpha-Omega Project <https://alpha-omega.dev/>`_. “At Alpha-Omega, we are
excited to support the Python Software Foundation as they improve the security
of PyPI, and more generally the Python ecosystem as a whole.” Alpha Omega
Representative - Bob Callaway, Google

begins his work with Python and the` Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_
(PyPI) this week. He says, “The Python community is such a positive part of my
life so I'm grateful for this incredible opportunity to contribute back. I'm
looking forward to partnering with all of you to build a more secure Python
ecosystem for everyone!” We hope that everyone in the community will welcome
Seth and help him succeed in his audit and subsequent plans for key security
improvements.

This role is funded by a substantial investment from the` Open Software
Security Foundation <https://openssf.org/>`_ (OpenSSF)` Alpha-Omega
