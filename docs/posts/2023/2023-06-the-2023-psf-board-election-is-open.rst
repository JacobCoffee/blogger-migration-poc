====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/06/the-2023-psf-board-election-is-open.html>`_.

It’s time to cast your vote! Voting takes place from today Tuesday, June 20,
through Friday, June 30, 2023 11:59pm UTC. If you are a voting member of the
PSF, you should have gotten an email from “OpaVote Voting Link
<noreply@opavote.com>” with your ballot, the subject line will read “Python
Software Foundation Board of Directors Election 2023”. If you haven’t seen
your ballot by Wednesday, please 1) check your spam folder for a message from
“noreply@opavote.com” and if you don’t see anything 2) get in touch by
emailing psf-elections@python.org so we can make sure we have the most up to
date email for you.

Four seats are open, but you can approve as many candidates as you like. BUT!
Choose carefully before you press the *big green vote button*. Once your
vote is cast, it cannot be changed.  
  
We’re overwhelmed by how many of you are willing to contribute to the Python
community by serving on the PSF board! Make sure you schedule some time to
`look at all their
statements <https://www.python.org/nominations/elections/2023-python-software-
foundation-board/nominees/>`_ and choose your candidates carefully. OpaVote
doesn’t let you go back and change your vote once you’ve made your choices.
