There are two ways to join in the drive this year:
--------------------------------------------------

  * `*Donate directly to the PSF!* <https://psfmember.org/civicrm/contribute/transact/?reset=1&id=49>`_ Every dollar makes a difference. (Does every dollar also make a puppy‚Äôs tail wag? We make no promises, but may you should try, just in case? üê∂)

  * `*Become a member!* <https://psfmember.org/>`_ Sign up as a Supporting member of the PSF. Be a part of the PSF, and help us sustain what we do with your annual support.

Or, heck, why not do both? ü•≥

 *Your Donations:*

  * Keep Python thriving 

  * Invest directly in CPython and PyPI progress

  * Bring the global Python community together

  * Make our community more diverse and robust every year

  

Let‚Äôs take a look back on 2023:
-------------------------------

*PyCon US* \- We held our `20th PyCon US <https://us.pycon.org/2023/>`_, in
Salt Lake City and online, which was an exhilarating success! For the online
component, PyCon US OX, we added two moderated online hallway tracks (in
Spanish and English) and saw a 33% increase in virtual engagement. It was
great to see everyone again in 2023, and we‚Äôre grateful to all the speakers,
volunteers, attendees, and sponsors who made it such a special event.  
  
*Security Developer in Residence* \- Seth Larson joined the PSF earlier this
year as our first ever Security Developer-in-Residence. Seth is already well-
known to the Python community ‚Äì he was named a PSF Fellow in 2022 and has
already written a lot about Python and security on `his
blog <https://sethmlarson.dev/blog>`_. This critical role would not be possible
without funding from the OpenSSF `Alpha-Omega Project <https://alpha-
omega.dev/>`_.  
  
*PyPI Safety & Security Engineer *\- Mike Fiedler joined the PSF earlier
this year as our first ever PyPI Safety & Security Engineer. Mike is already a
dedicated member of the Python packaging community ‚Äì he has been a Python user
for some 15 years, maintains and contributes to open source, and became a PyPI
Maintainer in 2022. You can see some of what he's achieved for PyPI already on
the `PyPI blog <https://blog.pypi.org/>`_. This critical role would not be
possible without funding from `AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/>`_.  
*  
Welcome, Marisa and Marie!* \- In 2023 we were able to add two new full time
staff members to the PSF. Marisa Comacho joined as Community Events Manager
and `Marie Nordin joined <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/10/announcing-
community-communications-mgr.html>`_ as Community Communications Manager. We are
excited to add two full time dedicated staff members to the PSF to support
PyCon US, our communications, and the community as a whole.  
*  
CPython Developer in Residence* \- Our CPython Developer in Residence, ≈Åukasz
Langa, continued to provide trusted support and advancement of the Python
language, including oversight for the releases of Python 3.8 and 3.9, adoption
of Sigstore, and stewardship of PEP 703 (to name a few of many!). ≈Åukasz also
engaged with the community by orchestrating the `Python Language
Summit <https://us.pycon.org/2023/events/language-summit/>`_ and participating
in events such as `PyCon US 2023 <https://us.pycon.org/2023/>`_,
`EuroPython <https://ep2023.europython.eu/>`_, and `PyCon
Colombia <https://2023.pycon.co/>`_. This critical role would not be possible
without funding from `Meta <https://about.facebook.com/meta/>`_.  
  
*Authorized as CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)* \- Being authorized as a CNA
is one milestone in the Python Software Foundation's strategy to improve the
vulnerability response processes of critical projects in the Python ecosystem.
The `Python Software Foundation CNA
scope <https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/PSF>`_
covers `Python <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_ and
`pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_, two projects which are fundamental to the
rest of Python ecosystem.  
*  
Five new Fiscal Sponsorees* \- Welcome to
`Bandit <https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit>`_, `BaPya <https://www.bapya.org/>`_,
`Twisted <https://twisted.org/>`_, `PyOhio <https://www.pyohio.org/2023/>`_, and
`North Bay Python <https://2023.northbaypython.org/>`_ as new Fiscal Sponsorees
of the PSF! The PSF provides 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to fiscal sponsorees
and provides back office support so they can focus on their missions.
