Join the Python Developers Survey 2017: Share and learn about the community
===========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/09/join-python-developers-survey-2017.html>`_.

2017 is drawing to a close and we are super-excited to start the official
*Python Developers Survey 2017*!  
  
Weâ€™ve created this survey specially for Python developers who use it as their
primary or supplementary language. We expect the survey findings to help us
map an accurate landscape of the Python developer community and to provide
insight into the current major trends in the Python community.  
  

`*Please take a few minutes to complete the Python Developers Survey
2017!* <https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c11-python-developers-survey-2017>`_

  
Your valuable opinion and feedback will help us better understand how
different Python developers use Python and related frameworks, tools and
technologies. We also hope you'll have fun going through the questions.  
  
The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation
and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated
results and randomly choose 100 winners (from those who complete the survey in
its entirety), who will each receive an amazing *Python Surprise Gift Pack*.
