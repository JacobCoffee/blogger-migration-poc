PythonDay Mexico: Recap of the Inaugural PythonDay in Mexico
============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/09/pythonday-mexico-recap-of-inaugural.html>`_.

It has been three years since I first  learned about PyCon. I watched some
workshops and talks and I was amazed by how inviting, open and inclusive the
community was. In fact, that was one of the key aspects that inspired me to
learn Python, use it, help build the Python community here in Mexico.

*  
*  

Fast forward to the beginning of this year: I was contacted by the organizer
of LinuxChix in Mexico, who is also member of PyLadies, with the idea of
organizing a PythonDay in Mexico. This first PythonDay, she suggested,  had
the purpose of bringing a PyCon to Mexico. We eventually found another woman
who shared the same ideal and we set about working to bring the Mexican Python
community to an event that, hopefully, inspired them to be better Pythonistas
the same way the first PyCon i witnessed did to me.

*  
*  

We first wondered how big of a community we had in Mexico. Despite being
involved with Python for three years I barely knew the people or meet ups,
apart from PyLadies, in Mexico devoted to the language. We figured that with
Mexico being a country of 130 million there was large chance there would be a
sizable population interested in Python. Along the way we discovered that the
Python community in Mexico is not only vast, but also scattered across the
nation. These reasons only encouraged us more to organize a PythonDay, it
would be a great starting point to bring together the community.

Who came to PythonDay Mexico
----------------------------

We selected June 10, 2017 as the day for the first PythonDay Mexico. People
from all over the country came to meet their fellow Pythonistas and listen to
the amazing talks we selected for this year.

Initially we expected about 160 people, but we could not have been farther
off! Over 400 people registered for the event and in its peak, approximately
300 Pythonistas were in attendance. We were glad to learn that 30% of the
attendees in the event were women, which is not a high number, but in
comparison to the roughly 15% of  women in technology it gives hope to learn
that many women are interested in programming.

Attendees traveled up to 1270 miles to attend PythonDay Mexico. In terms of
geography there were attendees from Sinaloa, Jalisco, Hidalgo, Nuevo Leon,
Puebla, Mexico City and Yucatan and every one of them was excited to hear the
talks and workshops as well as to meet other Python lovers.

During the event we did not have any incident or complaint; everybody followed
and honored the Code of Conduct lending to a greatly collaborative. Honestly
we could not have asked for a better audience. But then again, Python
communities all over the world are like this, awesome.

A Global Selection of Python Speakers
-------------------------------------

PythonDay Mexico had an amazingly diverse set of speakers. We had people from
Paraguay, India, USA, Italy, Germany and Mexico. Even if our speakers could
not be physically present, they made efforts to actually engage and interact
with the audience in their remote presentations. Many of our remote speakers
are a part of the Python Software Foundation Board of Directors like Naomi
Ceder, Trey Hunner. Board member Lorena Mesa gave her talk in person.

*  
*  

Topics covered by the talks and workshops included data science, machine
learning (e.g. deep learning), CPython, Python core development, Python in web
development, Python extensions in other languages (Rust, Go), Testing,
building bots with Python and getting Python ready for production. The range
of topics permitted a bit of something for everyone.

We at PythonDay want to thank everyone that helped make this possible. The
organizers spent many months talking, planning, getting funds and convincing
people that Mexico is a great place for Python. The PSF was a major player in
the making of this event, given that not only were they one of our major
sponsors but were also a wonderful source of speakers, advice and even
promotion of the event. Of course the speakers and volunteers were also a huge
part of the success of this event. Finally, the event would not have been
possible without the attendees, without them the event would only have been a
bunch of speakers and swag.

Whatâ€™s next?

  
  

Our mission after PythonDay Mexico is to bring a PyCon to Mexico and to keep
connecting all the people interested in Python within Mexico with programming
and events. For PyConMx we are actively seeking volunteers and organizers, if
you'd like to help us or learn more you can contact us at
`pythonday.mx@gmail.com <mailto:pythonday.mx@gmail.com>`_ or
`mx@pyladies.com <mailto:mx@pyladies.com>`_, we really hope to hear from you!
