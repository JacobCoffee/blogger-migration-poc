Au revoir PyCon Pune
====================

February 2017 marked the beginning of a new journey for a new regional Python
Conference - `PyCon Pune <https://pune.pycon.org/2017/>`_.  
  
PyCon is the meeting place for community. It gives Pythonistas an opportunity
to come out of the virtual world and meet the real people behind the nicknames
and the handles. It gives them an opportunity to learn new things and share
their knowledge with others.  
  
Considering the vast geographical territory of India, a single PyCon event
wasn’t sufficient. PyCon Pune offered the Python community another chance to
interact.  
  
It was a four-day event; the main conference on the first two days and
development sprints the second two. It was a single-track event, so all 550
attendees could attend all the sessions.

The inside story:
-----------------

  
Pune, also known as the Oxford of the East, is amongst the fastest growing
cities in the Asia Pacific region. Pune witnessed this PyCon at a hotel called
Amonora, the Fern. The venue was beautiful, and we were grateful to have it:
just a few weeks before the conference began, we were afraid we would have no
venue at all!  
  
The event had been located at one of oldest engineering colleges in Pune, but
the venue canceled two weeks prior to the conference. Not quite the kind of
news any organizers would like to hear, last minute (I can vouch for that, I
was one of them).  
  
Python Software Foundation then extended its hand to help. Team PyCon Pune as
well as the Python community in India cannot thank the PSF enough for this.

PyLadies in PyCon Pune:
-----------------------

  
The PSF has always been a huge supporter of
`PyLadies <http://www.pyladies.com/>`_. This time, they offered to share their
booth with us. PyLadies had a huge presence at the event. From volunteering,
to management, PyLadies were there everywhere. Yes, “Python is for girls.” And
if we PyLadies need support in the face of a crisis, the PSF is there to hold
us.

United we stand:
----------------

The first ever thing that we decided for the conference was the quote to be
used on the conference t-shirt.  
  

> “Came for the language, stayed for the community”, by `Brett
> Cannon <https://twitter.com/brettsky>`_

  
This set the tone of the conference. The conference is a completely volunteer-
driven event: the website, finance, AV and the overall management were run by
volunteers, celebrating the community in the truest sense. Help poured in from
pythonistas worldwide. The logo was designed by `Ryan
Larch <https://twitter.com/ryanlerch>`_ from Australia. Python communities from
all over India along with Python Pune and PyLadies worked tirelessly together
to make the event a success. These people keep the soul of Python (the
community and language) alive.

Day 1 and Day 2 of the main conference:
---------------------------------------

  
With a welcome note by `Kushal Das <https://twitter.com/kushaldas>`_, the chair
commenced the conference. The first keynote was by `Honza
Král <https://twitter.com/HonzaKral>`_. He talked about his journey in the open
source world. It was interesting to know about his hurdles and how he overcame
them. It is also always inspiring to see at masters were students once too.
Next, `Anand Chitipothu <https://twitter.com/anandology>`_ taught us to write
beautiful code.The post-lunch session began with the keynote by the “official
Perl guy” of the Python community, `John “Warthog”
Hawley <https://twitter.com/warty9>`_, who described the path from software to
hardware hacking.  
  
The day ended with an enchanting experience - a keynote by `Pravin
Patil <https://twitter.com/_gnovi>`_, a teacher who uses Python to teach
Physics. Python plus Physics plus a Laser equaled magic in his presentation.  
  
`Katie Cunningham <https://twitter.com/kcunning>`_ began Day 2, followed by the
Economics Professor `Stephen Turnbull <https://twitter.com/yasegumi>`_. He has
helped to develop Ghostscript, XEmacs, Python, and GNU Mailman. He offered a
word of encouragement to us saying, “You can help develop Python - and you
should!” After lunch, `Nick Coghlan <https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev>`_
delivered his keynote. He discussed “opportunities and challenges in open
collaboration.” The last keynote talk was by `Terri
Oda <https://twitter.com/terriko>`_, about security in the open source world.  
  
This led to the end of the main conference. The mentors for the dev sprints
spoke on what they were going to work on. An open feedback session marked the
close of the main conference.  
  

Day 3 and Day 4 of the Developers Sprint
----------------------------------------

  
For sprints, the conference moved to the Red Hat office in Pune. A dozen
projects added features and fixed bugs during the final two days of the
conference. The sprints had proven to be the most popular portion of the
conference: Tickets had sold out within a week.  
  
The Red Hat office looked like a hackerspace over the weekend. People were
coding, learning, having fun and celebrating Python. It was the first ever dev
sprint experience for more than 95% of the attendees. It took most of the
people to some time to understand what is going on and how they could
participate.  
  
Slowly folks started flocking around different mentors. There were good number
of people gathering around Nick—many Pythonistas have a dream to become
CPython core developers. More than 10 patches were submitted to the language.
Web.py, ElasticSearch, Django, es-django-example, OpenCabs, Pagure and
micropython held sprints as well. The actual number of patches submitted can
be found `here <https://kushaldas.in/posts/pycon-pune-2017.html>`_.  
  
I took shelter in the micropython and hardware room, where we were worked on
fun bunny boards with esp8266 devices. John was there guiding us, changing our
lives (my life for certain) `with blinking LEDs <https://anweshadas.in/my-
bunnyuncle/>`_. The best surprise came at the end. He gave each of us a bunny
board. What a lovely souvenir to take home!  
  
The conference is intended to give people the feeling of community. The event
is over but the spirit is hasn’t diminished. Please join us next year for
`PyCon Pune 2018 <https://pune.pycon.org/2018/>`_, February 8 - 11.
