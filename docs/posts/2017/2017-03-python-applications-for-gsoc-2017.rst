Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program that offers post-secondary
students an opportunity to be paid for contributing to an open source project
over a three-month period. Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation (PSF)
has served as an "umbrella organization" to a variety of Python-related
projects, as well as sponsoring projects related to the development of the
Python language.

  
April 3rd is the last date for student applications for GSoC 2017. You can
`view all the sub-orgs under PSF and see what projects are seeking
applications <http://python-gsoc.org/#ideas>`_, then go to the `Google Summer of
Code site <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/>`_ to submit your application.
