2017 Frank Willison Memorial Award Goes To Katie Cunningham And Barbara Shaurette
=================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/05/2017-frank-willson-memorial-award-goes.html>`_.

Every year the Python Software Foundation awards the `Frank Willison Memorial
Award <https://www.python.org/community/awards/frank-willison/>`_ to a member(s)
of the Python community. The purpose of this award is to recognize the
outstanding contributions that Python community members have made having began
as an award, “established in memory of Frank Willison, a Python enthusiast and
O'Reilly editor-in-chief, who died in July 2001”.

  

The Python Software Foundation has awarded the 2017 Frank Willison Award to
Katie Cunningham and Barbara Shaurette in recognition of their work creating
Young Coders classes.  Cunningham and Shaurette have gone above and beyond
making the Young Coders teaching materials freely available.

  

The program began at PyCon 2013 in Santa Clara and was an immediate success.
The `follow-up blog post <http://pycon.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-kids-stole-
show-young-coders.html>`_ is the second most popular post in PyCon's history by
a wide margin. Additionally the event was one of the most talked about topics
of the 2013 conference.

`i <http://jessenoller.com/>`_d`e <http://jessenoller.com/>`_a`
 <http://jessenoller.com/>`_to `Cunningham <http://therealkatie.net/>`_ asking her
to lead it. Cunningham  then reached out to
`Shaurette <http://www.mechanicalgirl.com/>`_ seeking her assistance, or as she
said, “Omg help!”

  

Shaurette has experience teaching early childhood education. Her experience
teaching younger students came in handy as she reworked materials used for
adult classes into the `materials the program uses
today <https://github.com/mechanicalgirl/young-coders-tutorial>`_. The class
includes Raspberry Pis, keyboards, and a mouse that the students were allowed
to take with them, along with two books `Python for
Kids <https://www.nostarch.com/pythonforkids>`_ and `Hello World! Computer
Programming for Kids and Other Beginners <https://smile.amazon.com/Hello-
World-Computer-Programming-Beginners/dp/1617290920>`_.

  

The first class for students aged 10 to 12 did not go without hitches.  That
year there were a lot of technical issues with the Raspberry Pis. Noah
Kantrowitz saved the day helping Cunningham and Barbara getting the Raspberry
Pi’s set up. “The setup is a little complex, but he set the guidelines for
what equipment we use, and how we plan the classroom every year,” Shaurette
said.

  

“There were moments setting up that I said, ‘I don’t know if this is going to
work,” Cunningham  recalls.

  

That first class was eight hours. Then Katie and Barbara wrapped up and did it
again the next day for a second a time with a whole new class.

  

By the end of the first day it was already a noted success. “The enthusiasm
around it was insane. People were so excited that we were doing it. We were
off in our own corner and not central to the conference, but people were
stopping by and peeking in,” Cunningham  explains.

  

Once the kids were let loose to experiment, they tried all sorts of things.
“I don't think you'd ever see that kind of experimentation in a classroom full
of adults, who would more likely do everything in their power not to break
their computers,”  Shaurette wrote of the kids’ ability to learn, write, and
run code.

  

The second day was a whole new class, but this time it was a group of 13 to 16
year olds, and just as successful. “One thing that I find is how energizing
the kids get at the end,” Cunningham said.

  

Not long after that, Young Coders was approached by the PyOhio and PyTennessee
organizers. Both conferences have held Young Coders nearly every year since.
`Brad Montgomery <https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/>`_ has taken over
responsibility in PyTennessee, but  Cunningham  still runs the workshop at
PyOhio.

  

Since the start of the program  Cunningham  and Shaurette have taught over 400
kids!

  
We thank Cunningham and Shaurette  for their work in actively promoting and
teaching Python to a new generation of programmers.
