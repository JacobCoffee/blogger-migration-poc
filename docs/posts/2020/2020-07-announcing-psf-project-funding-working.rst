Announcing the PSF Project Funding Working Group
================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/07/announcing-psf-project-funding-working.html>`_.

  

For the past 3 years, the PSF `has been working
on <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/search/label/pypi>`_ grant funded projects to
improve our internal systems and platforms. This work has been done with the
Packaging Working Group, and focused on our packaging ecosystem of PyPI and
pip. We have been able to show that applying directed funding to open source
projects has the ability to dramatically increase the speed of development,
and move our community forward in a much more sustained way than relying
solely on volunteer effort.

  

Along with the external grant funding of PSF projects, we have also committed
PSF funds in the past to improve developments of community projects. This
shows that the experience of directed funding is applicable to our community
projects, as well as our own. An example here is the BeeWare project that was
given funding via our Education Grants last year:

Another wonderful example has been a number of scientific Python projects that
have raised large amounts of grant funding, mostly through
`NumFocus <https://numfocus.org/>`_. They have
`been <https://numfocus.org/blog/astropy-receives-900k-grant-from-moore-

receives-first-ever-funding-thanks-to-moore-foundation>`_ our focus on grant
funding as an important source of revenue for open source projects. The
scientific open source community has been immeasurably improved by this
funding, and we hope to expand this opportunity to the entire Python
community.

Helping the community get funding
---------------------------------

  

The PSF has created the `Project Funding Working
Group <https://wiki.python.org/psf/ProjectFundingWG>`_ to help our community
seek similar funding for their own projects. We hope to expand the amount of
money going into the Python community as a whole, by providing resources and
advice to projects who are interested in seeking funding from external
sources.

  

Our charter starts with our intended purpose:

  

This Working Group researches, and advises Python community volunteers on
applying for external grants and similar funding to advance the mission of the
PSF, which includes, but is not limited to, things such as advancing the
Python core, Python-related infrastructure, key Python projects, and Python
education and awareness.

You can read the `entire
charter <https://wiki.python.org/psf/ProjectFundingWG/Charter>`_ for more
information about the vision for the group that we intend to build over the
medium and long term.

Resources
---------

In the short term, the first resource that we have put together is a `list of
potential funders <https://github.com/psf/project-funding-
wg/blob/master/funders.md>`_ that are applicable to our community. Itâ€™s on
GitHub, and we welcome contributions to the list if you know of additional
sources of funding. The other initial resource we are able to provide is
advice, so if you have any questions about funding, you can email us at
`project-funding-wg@python.org <mailto:project-funding-wg@python.org>`_, and we
will do our best to help. We can advise you on picking tasks to propose,
making a budget, writing a proposal, and more.

We are excited about the possibilities for the Python community when we see
more funding being applied to our mission. There is a lot of amazing open
source software out there being built by volunteers, and we hope that giving
them additional resources will create even more impact for our mission of
advancing the Python community.
