Join the Python Developers Survey 2020: Share and learn about the community
===========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/10/join-python-developers-survey-2020.html>`_.

 This year we are conducting the fourth iteration of the official Python
Developers Survey. The goal is to capture the current state of the language
and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year’s, we can
identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community
and the key insights into it.

In 2019, more than 24,000 Python users from 150 countries participated and
shared with us how they use the language.

We encourage you to contribute to our community’s knowledge. The survey should
only take you about 10 minutes to complete.

Contribute to the `Python Developers Survey
2020 <https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c12-python-developers-survey-2020>`_!

The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation
and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated
results and randomly choose 100 winners (among those who complete the survey
in its entirety), who will each receive an amazing Python Surprise Gift Pack.
