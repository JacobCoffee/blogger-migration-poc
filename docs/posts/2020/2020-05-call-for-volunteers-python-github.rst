Call for Volunteers! Python GitHub Migration Work Group
=======================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/05/call-for-volunteers-python-github.html>`_.

Call for community volunteers! It is time to assemble a Python Work Group that
will aid in Python’s migration to GitHub!

`PEP 581 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/>`_ was accepted and Python
is now starting to plan for the actual migration (per `PEP
588 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0588/>`_)!

We are looking for volunteers to participate in a work group that will be
involved with Python’s migration from bugs.python.org to GitHub. We want to
make sure the directions this migration takes represents what the community
needs!

The transition will be completed with the assistance of GitHub’s team and `the
PSF will be contracting a Technical Project Manager to
assist <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/05/pythons-migration-to-github-
request-for.html>`_. Certain Steering Council members and PSF staff members will
be part of this work group as well!

The work group will help review contractor resumes, weigh in on discussions,
help guide decisions, help get community input, and have a close overview of
the entire project. If you have experience with Roundup and GitHub we want to
hear from you! We want to ensure that through this Work Group we have a wide
range of users represented. The discussions and decisions will help mold what
the final outcome will be.

Fill out this application form by May 27:
<https://forms.gle/jivuUdgViQPU4rKh8>. We will reach out soon after.
