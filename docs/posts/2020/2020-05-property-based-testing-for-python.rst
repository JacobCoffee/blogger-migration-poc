Zac Hatfield-Dodds opened his presentation with a paraphrase of the economist
Thomas Schelling:  

> _No matter how rigorous her analysis or heroic his imagination, no person
> can write a test case that would never occur to them._

Hatfield-Dodds told the Language Summit, handwritten tests are "fantastic for
testing particular edge cases, they're great regression tests," but they're
limited by the developer's understanding of the system under test. "We can't
write tests for bugs we don't know could occur." We can overcome this limit
with _exhaustive testing_ , checking our code's behavior with every possible
input; if that is impractical, _coverage-guided fuzz testing_ can generate
random inputs and evolve them, trying to explore every branch in the code
under test. Fuzzers are very good at finding inputs that crash a program, but
they're not as well suited for finding other kinds of bugs.

For testing the Python standard library, Hatfield-Dodds proposed a different
technique: _property-based testing_. (He is one of the leaders of the
`Hypothesis property-based testing
project <https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/>`_.) A property-based test framework
doesn't generate totally random input like a fuzzer; it can generate
structured inputs such as lists of numbers, or only sorted lists, or instances
of a certain object. Unlike handwritten tests, which usually assert that a
particular input produces one exact output, property-based tests assert
_properties_ of a function, for example that its output is sorted, or that a
function is idempotent or commutative.  
  
Hatfield-Dodds presented the following Hypothesis test of a JSON codec:  

    
    
    @given(
        value=st.recursive(
            st.none() | st.booleans() | st.floats() | st.text(),
            lambda x: st.lists(x) | st.dictionaries(st.text(), x),
        )
    )
    def test_record_json_roundtrip(value):
        assume(value == value)
        assert value == json.loads(json.dumps(value))
    

The `recursive` input generator can create None, booleans, floats, text, or
lists or dictionaries that contain such values, and so on recursively. Within
the test function, the `assume` statement checks that the input is equal to
itself, to avoid inputs with `nan`, which is not. The heart of the test is the
`assert` statement.  
  
(The above example still has troubles with `nan`, `see Hatfield-Dodds' PyCon
Australia talk <https://zhd.dev/sufficiently/>`_.)  
  
Hypothesis searches for bugs by randomizing the input, or trying interesting
values that tend to trigger edge cases, or retrying inputs that triggered bugs
in previous runs. When Hypothesis finds a bug, it evolves the input, searching
for the simplest input that reproduces the same bug.

"I want you all to write property-based tests for CPython, for builtins, for
PyPy, for everything," said Hatfield-Dodds. He proposed to write new tests, or
port existing ones to a property-based test framework, run them in CPython's
continuous integration suite, and share them among the Python implementations.
These tests could use Hypothesis; they could also be integrated with the `AFL
fuzzer <https://github.com/google/AFL>`_ or used in `Google's OSS-
Fuzz <https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz>`_ project. He presented a `repository
of tests <https://github.com/Zac-HD/stdlib-property-tests>`_ demonstrating the
technique for standard library modules such as `gzip`, `re`, and `datetime`.
There is even `a test that can generate random, valid Python
code <https://github.com/Zac-HD/stdlib-property-
tests/blob/master/tests/test_source_code.py>`_ to fuzz-test the Python parser.  
  
≈Åukasz Langa mentioned that `David MacIver had used Hypothesis to test a
Python code formatter <https://www.drmaciver.com/2015/03/27-bugs-in-24-hours/>`_
and found dozens of bugs.  
  
Paul Ganssle told the Summit that he used property-based testing for his
implementation of
`datetime.fromisoformat <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.fromisoformat>`_.
When the function was merged into the standard library the property-based
tests were not. In subsequent development Ganssle introduced a segfault bug
that "almost certainly would have been caught" if the original tests had still
been running. He strongly endorsed Hatfield-Dodds's idea. He added that
property-based testing is especially good at checking that two implementations
of a module, one written in Python and one in C, are equivalent.
