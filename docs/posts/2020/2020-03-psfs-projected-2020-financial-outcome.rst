PSF's Projected 2020 Financial Outcome
======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/03/psfs-projected-2020-financial-outcome.html>`_.

The `Python Software Foundation (PSF) <https://www.python.org/psf/>`_ is a
501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the Python community and
programming language, as well as running PyCon US. Since `PyCon US 2020 was
cancelled <https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/pycon-us-2020-in-
pittsburgh.html>`_, the community has asked how the PSF’s finances will be
affected. Let us take a look at the projected 2020 financial outcome.

Bottom Line
-----------

As of today, the PSF will use approximately $627,000 from our financial
reserve:

| Expenses| Revenue|  
---|---|---|---  
*PSF*|  $1,300,000| $550,000| -$750,000  
*PyCon*|  $280,000| $403,000| $123,000  
| | *Total*|  -$627,000  
  
If you are interested in how we arrived at these estimates, continue reading
to learn about our projected expenses and revenue for this year.

Expenses
--------

PyCon US 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pittsburgh and its vendors have been incredibly helpful in reducing or
eliminating most of the 2020 conference minimums and cancellation fees. We
estimate $280,000 in expenses for pre-conference work related to website/logo
design and nonrefundable deposits. In addition, we budgeted significant funds
to support travel grantees with non-reimbursable costs, as well as executing
PyCon 2020 remote content. Once travel grants and instructor fees are
complete, we will revise the expense total.

PSF
~~~

Through March 2020, the PSF awarded several
`grants* <https://www.blogger.com/u/1/blogger.g?blogID=8520#grants>`_, expended
legal fees to protect PyLadies trademarks in dozens of countries, and employed
staff. The PSF is projected to spend $1,300,000 in 2020.

Revenue
-------

PyCon US 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyCon US registration and sponsorship revenue is used to produce PyCon, with
the largest costs going to food, audio-visual services, and travel grants.

Our staff works to create the best and most affordable attendee experience
possible with the added benefit that 100% of net proceeds fund the PSF. For
2020, we estimated PyCon’s net income at $720,000. As of today, we are
estimating PyCon's net income to be $123,000, thanks to individual donations
and sponsorship fees.

PSF
~~~

PSF 2020 sponsorships are estimated at $350,000. COVID-19 is impacting
financial markets and job security, so we expect individual donations and
memberships to decrease in 2020 by 55% from 2019 to around $200,000.

How can you help?
-----------------

The PSF’s financial reserve is crucial, as we experienced during the economic
downturn of 2008 and again in 2020. The cash reserve prepares us for economic
impacts, events out of our control, and provides a stable environment with
health benefits for our employees, even during this difficult time.

Here are ways community members can help and get involved:

  * Become a `free or supporting member <https://www.python.org/psf/membership/>`_ of the PSF to get involved in our future
  * Donate some or all of your PyCon registration (*_thank you_* to those that already have)
  * `Donate <https://www.python.org/psf/donations/>`_ directly to the PSF
  * Donate some or all of your company's PyCon's sponsorship (*_thank you_*  to those that already have)
  * Ask your employer to `sponsor the PSF <https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/>`_
  * Ask your employer if they match donations to 501(c)(3) non-profits, and ask for your donations to the PSF to be matched
  * `Sign up for the PSF’s free newsletter <https://www.python.org/psf/newsletter/>`_ to stay up to date

  
We wish our entire community good health.

`* <https://www.blogger.com/u/1/null>`_ PSF Grants: When PyCon 2020 was
cancelled, the PSF paused its Grants Program until we can find virtual options
and other ways to support events, as well as fully understand the PSF’s
financial situation.
