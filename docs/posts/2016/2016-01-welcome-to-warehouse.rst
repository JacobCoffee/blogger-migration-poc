Welcome to the Warehouse!
=========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/01/welcome-to-warehouse.html>`_.

Warehouse is the new codebase being developed to power the Python Packaging
Index (PyPI). Python developers and users already know that PyPI is the
official comprehensive repository of third-party open source Python packages
(see `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index>`_). PyPI,
maintained by the PSF, is where developers publish their software modules and
from which package managers, such as pip, download packages. Given the
important role played by PyPI, the Warehouse project is bound to have a huge
impact on the continued use and growth of Python.

While many volunteers have been working on the project, the biggest
contributions have come from lead developer Donald Stufft and web-design
specialist, Nicole Harris. Donald, based in the US, is a core contributor to
PyPI (as well as to CPython, pip, virtualenv, Django & Cryptography), while
UK-based Nicole runs a web development business, `Kabu
Creative <http://kabucreative.com/>`_.

The design goals, as stated on Nicole's
`website <http://whoisnicoleharris.com/2015/12/31/designing-warehouse-an-
overview.html>`_, were:

  * To update the visual identity 
  * To make packages more discoverable
  * To accommodate the needs of both users and package maintainers 
  * To give the project the same level of professionalism as a commercial project of the same scale 
  * To ensure that the user experience reflects the Python communityâ€“a community that is welcoming, helpful and inclusive

Donald and Nicole have recently released a first look at the new design on the
demo sites, `Warehouse <https://warehouse.python.org/>`_ and `Warehouse
staging <https://warehouse-staging.python.org/>`_.

Looking great, thanks to Donald and Nicole's hard work, but there is plenty
more to be done: writing code, writing the user guide (PyPUG), usability
testing, and giving feedback. Details on how to volunteer and more info can be
found on `Nicole's site <http://whoisnicoleharris.com/2015/12/31/designing-
warehouse-an-overview.html>`_.
