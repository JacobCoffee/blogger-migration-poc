`As we announced last week <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/04/run-
for-2016-board-of-directors.html>`_, the Python Software Foundation is seeking
candidates for this year's directors. Nominations are open now until the end
of May 15 `Anywhere on
Earth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth>`_.  
  
Candidates from anywhere in the world are welcome; members of the Board do not
need to be residents or citizens of the United States. There are 11 directors,
elected annually for a term of one year. Directors are unpaid volunteers.  
  
The list of nominees is on the PSF wiki:

If have a passion for the Python language and community, add yourself to the
list! If someone you know would make a great member of the board, ask if
they'd like you to nominate them.
