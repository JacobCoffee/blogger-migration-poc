Brett Cannon wins Frank Willison Award
======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/05/brett-cannon-wins-frank-willison-award.html>`_.

  

This morning at OSCON, O'Reilly Media gave Brett Cannon the Frank Willison
Memorial Award. The award recognizes Cannon's contributions to CPython as a
core developer and project manager for over a decade.

  

Beginning in 2002, the `Frank Willison Memorial Award for Contributions to the
Python Community <https://www.python.org/community/awards/frank-willison/>`_ is
given annually to an outstanding contributor to the Python community. The
award was established in memory of Frank Willison, a Python enthusiast and
O'Reilly editor-in-chief, who died in July 2001. Tim O'Reilly wrote `In Memory
of Frank Willison <http://www.oreilly.com/news/frank_0701.html>`_, which
includes a collection of quotes from Frank's insightful and witty writing.
O'Reilly Media maintains `an online archive of Frank Willison's column,
"Frankly Speaking" <http://www.oreilly.com/frank/>`_.

  

O'Reilly Media presents the Frank Willison Memorial Award annually at OSCON,
the O'Reilly Open Source Convention. The recipient is chosen in consultation
with Guido van Rossum and delegates of the Python Software Foundation.

> Contributions can encompass so much more than code. A successful software
> community requires time, dedication, communication, and education as well as
> elegant code. With the Frank Willison Memorial Award, we hoped to
> acknowledge all of those things.

>   â€” Tim O'Reilly

In the open source community, project management is an often underrated skill:
given a problem to be solved, and a proposed solution for solving it, define
the concrete steps necessary to get a group of volunteers from the point of
saying "We should do something about this" to "We have solved that problem".

  
Brett Cannon has repeatedly volunteered to handle project management
responsibilities that have significantly improved the CPython core development
infrastructure, from migration to a dedicated bugs.python.org infrastructure,
to the initial switch to a distributed version control system, to the current
adoption of a more automated development workflow.

Brett Cannon  
  
Since he began as a core developer in 2003, Brett has dedicated significant
time to ensuring that the design, implementation, and development of essential
parts of the CPython reference interpreter are accessible to new contributors.
He wrote the first versions of the `Python Developer's
Guide <https://docs.python.org/devguide/>`_ and the design documentation for the
CPython compiler. He converted the bulk of the import system's implementation
from C to Python, created the `"devinabox"
project <https://github.com/python/devinabox>`_ to make it easier for new
contributors to get started at development sprints, wrote the "Python-dev
Summaries" articles from 2002 to 2005, and moderated the python-ideas mailing
list since it began in December 2006.

  

Brett has served on the PSF Board of Directors from 2006-2010, and again from
2013-2014, and was PSF Vice President in 2006-2007, and Executive Vice
President from 2007-2010. He is also a gracious ambassador for the Python
development community. His thoughtful manner, genuine kindness, and sense of
humor have inspired many at PyCons over the years. Whether helping a new
contributor understand a code snippet at a sprint or encouraging a new speaker
with his confidence in them, Brett shares his positive character with us.
