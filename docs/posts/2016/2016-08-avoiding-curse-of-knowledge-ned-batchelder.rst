"Avoiding the Curse of Knowledge": Community Service Award Recipient Ned Batchelder
===================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/08/avoiding-curse-of-knowledge-ned-batchelder.html>`_.

Ned Batchelder didn't mean to get himself nominated for an award. He'd simply
`encouraged his Twitter
followers <https://twitter.com/nedbat/status/738871623844040704>`_ to "nominate
someone who made a difference for a PSF Community Service Award." A friend who
saw his tweet thought, "You know, the person who best exemplifies the
community spirit and community service of Python is Ned."  
  
In the second quarter of 2016, the Python Software Foundation recognized
Batchelder with a Community Service Award for his tireless work helping run
the Boston Python user group, being a regular speaker at conferences,
maintaining coverage.py, and being a friendly face for the community on IRC
and elsewhere.  
  

*Coverage.py and ByteRun*  
*  
* Batchelder maintains `coverage.py <https://coverage.readthedocs.io/>`_, a
tool for measuring Python programs' code coverage. It monitors a program under
test, to report which lines of source are executed and which are not.
Coverage.py fills a vital niche in the Python ecosystem, ensuring our code is
thoroughly tested, and Batchelder has developed it for well over a decade.  
  

As an offshoot of his coverage.py work, Batchelder began experimenting with a
project called `ByteRun <https://github.com/nedbat/byterun>`_ in 2013. His most
prominent contributor is Allison Kaptur, who wrote a chapter on the project
for `The Architecture of Open Source
Applications <http://aosabook.org/en/buy.html#fh>`_. "ByteRun is a Python
interpreter written in Python," she says. "It’s not like a real one. It does
now run most Python code that you throw at it, but Ned's original motivation
was to explore instruction-level coverage for coverage.py. There are lots of
cases where line-level coverage does not give the whole picture; he wanted to
see if he could do better. That was his motivation, but I joined the project
because I have an inexplicable love of byte code that I cannot justify."

  

Kaptur loved working on a codebase with Batchelder—despite his long
experience, he is patient with contributors and enthusiastic about their work.
When `she reported a significant
bug <https://github.com/nedbat/byterun/pull/10#issuecomment-45956985>`_ in his
implementation of stack frames and scopes in ByteRun, he celebrated the
discovery. "Wow, this is amazing! I'm humbled to learn that I had the data
stack wrong."

  
*Boston Python User Group*  
  
When Batchelder first attended the `Boston Python User
Group <http://www.meetup.com/bostonpython/>`_ a decade ago it was already going
strong. The group draws from Boston's big tech community, and it meets in
Cambridge's Kendall Square, the epicenter of the tech industry there.  
  

Under Batchelder's leadership the group has grown to over 6000 members. It was
for this achievement that his friend and colleague David Baumgold, when he
read Batchelder's tweet, nominated him for a Community Service Award. Baumgold
says, "He is very, very good at getting people to open up about what they’re
working on. He calls it pulling lightning talks out of people. He says, 'If
you don’t think you have a lightning talk in you, come and talk to me. In five
minutes I'll find your lightning talk.'"

  

Jessica McKellar, too, helped cultivate Boston Python for several years.
Batchelder admits, "I’m not great at bringing in other organizers and giving
them lots of control. But she was a big help in creating new events for the
group." The workshops for women that McKellar started unlocked a pent-up
demand in the area. McKellar created a follow-up event, the monthly Project
Night, where workshop participants could advance further. Batchelder says, "On
project nights people come and do what they want to do. When you run one of
those every month, you get a consistent rhythm going and people continue to
show up."  

  

Another reason for the group's size is Batchelder's stick–to–itiveness.
Organizing events for seven years and more isn't easy. There are nights he
asks himself, "Really? I’m going to Boston Python again? That’s what I’m doing
tonight?"  
  
But it's worth it: helping people use computers, for Batchelder, is as fun as
using computers himself. Even better is when he connects a newcomer to a
project or person that provides precisely what they need. "When I can do that,
I think—wow, I really nailed it. That was a good night."

  
*PyCon Talks*  
  

When PyCon's call for proposals opens each year, Batchelder considers what
question he's heard most often that year, and tries to come up with a "very
good answer" that is the core of a PyCon talk.  
  
But how does he compose the best answer he can?  
  
"There’s all these topics that lead to each other in a dense graph, but I'm
going to have to linearize it and speak one sentence after the other for 25
minutes." To trim that tree of knowledge to its trunk, Batchelder seeks the
principles that lead from the question to the solution. "I try to lay bare the
mechanisms that link them together."  
  

His `Unicode Sandwich talk <http://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html>`_ in
2012, for example, distilled a painfully complex question into a simple
answer. Programmers can handle Unicode correctly in their apps with his three
concise tips. And his `talk on looping and iteration in
Python <http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html>`_ covers topics so fundamental
that most Python programmers couldn't explain them much better than a mole
could explain digging. David Baumgold says, "Ned is very good at avoiding the
curse of knowledge. He's simultaneously very knowledgeable and also very
accessible to beginners."

*  
**Juggling*  
*  
* Ewa Jodlowska, the PSF Director of Operations, says that every Python
programmer she meets has a hidden talent. She was sitting at a table with
Batchelder at PyCon Montréal last year when he picked up a few pieces of fruit
and juggled them.  
  
Batchelder has been juggling for so long he cannot remember how he first
learned; perhaps from his father. Naturally, he teaches it too. At his
workplace, `Open edX <https://open.edx.org/about-open-edx>`_, "There’s a bunch
of people who learned how to juggle because they saw all the props on my desk.
Whenever we have company outings there always kids that want to learn."

  

At PyCon this year he held an Open Space for juggling. Jodlowska recalls it
was so popular it spilled out of the room. Batchelder stood in the hallway
juggling his pins, while the crowd surrounding him cheered him on.
