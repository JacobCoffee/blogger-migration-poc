Opening the BBC micro:bit
=========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/10/opening-bbc-microbit.html>`_.

As many of you will know, the PSF has been a partner in the British
Broadcasting Corporation's (BBC) `micro:bit
project <https://pyfound.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/a-million-children.html>`_. A
million devices capable of running `MicroPython <http://micropython.org/>`_ have
been distributed to every 11 and 12 year old in the UK. Those of you lucky
enough to attend `EuroPython <https://europython.eu/>`_ and `PyCon
UK <http://2016.pyconuk.org>`_ will have also been given a device to take home.

The PSF wouldn't be involved if the project were not open source, and *it has
always been the intention that all the software _and hardware designs_ should
be released under open licenses so that anyone can recreate the project
themselves*.

We're very pleased to continue our association with the project as a partner
with the new `MicroBit Foundation <http://microbit.org/>`_ ~ a charity tasked to
promote and develop the project now that the BBC is stepping away. (It was
always the intention of the BBC to step back once the UK "drop" of devices was
complete.)

A few days ago they revealed their website and the final piece of the jigsaw
was revealed: the hardware schematics.

If you're interested in learning more, `check out the hardware
page <http://tech.microbit.org/hardware/>`_, `learn about
MicroPython <https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ on the
micro:bit, `join the Slack channel <http://tech.microbit.org/get-
involved/where-to-find/>`_ and `take a look around the wider
project <http://tech.microbit.org/>`_.

It's a very cool device and puts Python firmly in the world of embedded
hardware and Internet of Things. It's also a great complementary device to the
Raspberry Pi: the skills children learn on the micro:bit transfer to the
Raspberry Pi and vice versa. That there is progression from complete beginner
to professional software developer is one of Python's great strengths.

Python is for everyone, no matter their age or ability. Having open embedded
hardware that runs MicroPython makes Python all the more available to
enterprising people all over the world.

Have fun!
