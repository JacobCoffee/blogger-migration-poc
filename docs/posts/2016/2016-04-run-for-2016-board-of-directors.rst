We Want You to Run for the 2016 Board of Directors
==================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/04/run-for-2016-board-of-directors.html>`_.

You don't have to be an expert, or a Python celebrity. If you care about
Python and you want to nurture our community and guide our future, we invite
you to join the Board.  
  
Nominations are open for the Python Software Foundation's Board of Directors
now through the end of May 15. Nominate yourself if you are able and inspired
to help the PSF fulfill its mission:  
  

*"The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers."*

  
If you know someone who would be an excellent director, ask if they would like
you nominate them!  
  
What is the job? Directors do the business of the PSF, including:  

  * Appoint PSF officers.
  * Manage the budget, allocate funds, and award grants.
  * Raise money and recruit sponsors.
  * Manage public relations, education, and outreach.
  * Perform the PSF's legal duties as a non-profit corporation.
  * Administer the PSF membership program and serve its members.
  * Protect Pythonâ€™s intellectual property rights and licenses: logos, trademarks, and open source licenses.

  
Read "`*Expectations of
Directors* <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/ExpectationsOfBoardDirectors>`_"
for details.  
  
There are 11 directors, elected annually for a term of one year. Directors are
unpaid volunteers. Candidates from anywhere in the world are welcome; members
of the Board do not need to be residents or citizens of the United States.  
  
The deadline for nominations is the end of May 15, `Anywhere on
Earth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth>`_ ("AoE"). As long as it
is May 15 somewhere, nominations are open. A simple algorithm is this: make
your nominations by 11:59pm on your local clock and you are certain to meet
the deadline. Ballots to vote for the board members will be sent May 20, and
the election closes May 30.  
  
If you're moved to nominate yourself or someone else, here are the
instructions:

actually vote in the election.
