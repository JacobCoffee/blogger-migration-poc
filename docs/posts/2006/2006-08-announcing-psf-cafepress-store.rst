Announcing the PSF CafePress store
==================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/08/announcing-psf-cafepress-store.html>`_.

Thanks to Tim Parkin's volunteer work, the PSF now has a CafePress storefront
at `www.cafepress.com/pydotorg <http://www.cafepress.com/pydotorg>`_.

You can order T-shirts, hats, and stickers featuring the blue-and-yellow
Python logo and the yellow-and-black PyCon logo. About 25% of the sale price
will be returned to the PSF to help fund our activities.
