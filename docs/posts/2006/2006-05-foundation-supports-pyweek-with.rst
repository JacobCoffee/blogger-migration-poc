Foundation Supports PyWeek with Hosting
=======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/05/foundation-supports-pyweek-with.html>`_.

May 1, 2006. PyWeek is a game programming challenge in which participants must
write a game in one week using Python. The second PyWeek challenge placed
heavy stress on a donated server infrastructure, highlighting the need for
more professional hosting facilties.

To ensure that PyWeek can continue to meet this growing demand the Python
Software Foundation today announced that it will support PyWeek by funding the
hosting facilities that are required to keep the increasingly popular event as
responsive as possible to participants.

Richard Jones, PyWeek's organizer, said "PyWeek challenges entrants to develop
a complete game in Python in a week. Inspired by similar programming
challenges and National Novel Writing Month, the event capitalises on the
extraordinary work people can produce under the combined influence of a very
short deadline and a community of like-minded people. This year there were
approximately 100 entries, of which about 35 were completed. The next PyWeek
will be in about 6 months.

"Response to the challenge was a little overwhelming for the volunteer hosting
but new hosting has been found with the PSF's help and PyWeek lives on!".
