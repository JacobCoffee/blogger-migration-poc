    I have also posted the old-style HTML to my starship.python.net account so that
    you get the pretty colors on action items: `http://python.net/~goodger/tmp/minutes-2006-02-14.html <http://python.net/%7Egoodger/tmp/minutes-2006-02-14.html>`_
    
    Adding support for colored action items to the new python.org stylesheet is on my to-do list.
    
    Coming soon: minutes of the PSF Members Meeting at PyCon 2006, and minutes of the board meeting at PyCon.
    
    â€” David Goodger, PSF Secretary
