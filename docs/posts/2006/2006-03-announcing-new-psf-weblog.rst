Announcing the new PSF weblog
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/03/announcing-new-psf-weblog.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is pleased to announce that we now have a
weblog for posting announcements, requests for help, calls for discussion,
organizational news such as meeting minutes, and PyCon-related news. The PSF
does many things, but often hasn't been very active in publishing the details.
I hope the existence of this weblog will provide the community with more
insight into what's going on. At today's IRC meeting of the PSF Board, we
voted on, and accepted, `a weblog policy <http://www.python.org/psf/weblog-
policy/>`_ that forms a set of guidelines about what can be posted here. No
weblog editor has been appointed yet. Some of you may remember that I posted a
call for an editor to psf-members last summer and got a number of responses at
the time. I've since ditched the SVN-based approach and set up this Blogger-
hosted weblog instead, so I'll be contacting the volunteers to see if they're
still interested.
