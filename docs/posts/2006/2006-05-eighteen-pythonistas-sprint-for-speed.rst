Eighteen Pythonistas Sprint for Speed
=====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/05/eighteen-pythonistas-sprint-for-speed.html>`_.

REYKJAVIK, Iceland, 17 May 2005: Two Python Software Foundation directors
(Steve Holden, Tim Peters) and a former director (Fredrik Lundh) are among a
group of eighteen Python developers traveling to Iceland this weekend to start
a six-day meeting dubbed the "Need for Speed" sprint. Participants are
coordinating through `the NeedForSpeed wiki
page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/NeedForSpeed>`_ in the Python wiki.

The sprint is sponsored by `EWT, LLC <http://www.ewtcareers.com/>`_ of Beverly
Hills, CA, with local support from Icelandic gaming company
`CCP <http://www.ccpgames.com/>`_. The technical goals are improvements to
Python's performance, but this event is also an experiment in collaboration
between the open source and the commercial worlds.
