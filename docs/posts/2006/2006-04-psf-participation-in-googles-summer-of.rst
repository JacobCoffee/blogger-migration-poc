PSF participation in Google's Summer of Code
============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/04/psf-participation-in-googles-summer-of.html>`_.

The PSF is planning to participate in Google's Summer of Code again, and is
calling for help from the community. Here's how you can help:

  * Suggest project ideas by recording them on `the SummerOfCode wiki page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode>`_. 
  * Volunteer to mentor a student. Send an e-mail to Neal Norwitz (nnorwitz at gmail dot com) to volunteer. 
You can discuss any SoC topic on
`soc2006@python.org <mailto:soc2006@python.org>`_
