Submission for Summer of Code proposals is now open
===================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/05/submission-for-summer-of-code.html>`_.

Students can now submit their Python-related proposals for Google's 2006
Summer of Code. Please see `the Summer of Code wiki
page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode>`_ for ideas and application
instructions.

We're also still accepting volunteers to mentor students. The wiki page also
has instructions for mentors.
