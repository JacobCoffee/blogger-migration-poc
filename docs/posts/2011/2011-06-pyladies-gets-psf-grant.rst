PyLadies gets a PSF Grant
=========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/06/pyladies-gets-psf-grant.html>`_.

The PSF has given a grant of US$1220 to the
`PyLadies <http://www.pyladies.com/>`_ for use at their women’s
`Python <http://python.org/>`_ events. In addition, the `Python
Sprints <http://pythonsprints.com/>`_ project `has announced a separate grant of
US$300 <http://pythonsprints.com/2011/06/9/pyladies-sprint-los-angeles/>`_ to
PyLadies to go toward organizing a Python sprint in Los Angeles.

PyLadies
^^^^^^^^

`PyLadies <http://www.pyladies.com/>`_ is a group of women who use and love the
Python programming language. They organize workshops, meetups, and hackathons
with a goal of increasing the number of women active in the Python community.
They started in Los Angeles, California, but plan to expand with local
chapters in other areas.

June 18: PyLadies/SoCal Python Interest Group Hackathon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `SoCal Python Interest Group <http://socal-piggies.org/scp>`_ and LA
PyLadies are two of LA’s biggest Python user groups. They are teaming up for a
day of sprinting Saturday June 18, 2011. Tickets are `available through the
eventbrite site <http://pyladies-hackathon.eventbrite.com/>`_.

Schedule:

  * 2-7pm: Hack on your own projects
  * 7-8pm: Dinner, drinks, and lightning talks
  * 8pm-midnight: Python Ladies’ Night 4 at The Hollywood Canteen. Gentlemen of the Python community and friends not attending the hackathon are invited too. The more, the merrier!

This is no ordinary sprint: thanks to the pythonsprints.com grant, at least 10
mentors will be on hand to provide one-on-one help and tutoring throughout the
event. Mentors will bring beginners up to speed and teach attendees a variety
of Python-related skills, such as `git <http://git-scm.org/>`_, `PyPI
packaging <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, `Sphinx
docs <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, installing Python, and other open-source
subjects. Think of this as free Python tutoring!

Free T-shirts for Open Source Work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Participants in the hackathon who release their projects as open source (or
contribute to an existing open source project) will receive limited-edition
PyLadies/PyLadies Supporter t-shirts, funded by the PSF.

Invite the Smart Women in Your Life
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The hackathon is open to participants of all skill levels. Invite a smart lady
or two of any age to attend the event with you. Even if they are absolute
beginners, the mentors will help them start learning Python through online
tutorials such as `Learn Python The Hard
Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/>`_, while you hack on other projects.
