PSF Funds readthedocs.org
=========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/psf-funds-readthedocsorg.html>`_.

The PSF Board has awarded a grant of USD $840 to the `Read the
Docs <http://readthedocs.org>`_ project for twelve months of hosting fees.

Read the Docs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Created by `Eric Holscher <http://ericholscher.com/>`_, `Charles
Leifer <http://charlesleifer.com/>`_, and `Bobby
Grace <http://bobbygrace.info/>`_, readthedocs.org is a documentation hosting
site born out of the 2010 Django Dash competition. The site monitors git,
Mercurial, and Subversion source repositories and automatically builds a
project's documentation using Sphinx. Users can also create documentation
directly through the site using a built-in editor.

The `code for Read the Docs <http://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org>`_ is itself
open source, and contributions from users and other interested parties are
always welcome.

More Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `original
announcement <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2010/aug/16/announcing-read-docs/>`_
of the site describes the background for the project and its motivation.

Eric's `presentation at PDX
Python <http://www.slideshare.net/ericholscher/read-the-docs>`_ in February 2011
includes details about the tools used to build the site.

The `Getting Started Guide <http://read-the-
docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ covers all of the details you need
to add the documentation for your project to the site.
