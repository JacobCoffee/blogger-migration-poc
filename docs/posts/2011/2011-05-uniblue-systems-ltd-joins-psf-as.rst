Uniblue Systems Ltd. Joins the PSF as Sponsor Member
====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/05/uniblue-systems-ltd-joins-psf-as.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is happy welcome
`Uniblue <http://www.uniblue.com/>`_ as a sponsor member. Uniblue is a software
company with products designed to improve the speed and stability of PC
operating systems.

Uniblue explained their interest in the Python Software Foundation:

> Our success with Python has shown us, clearly, how important is the strength
> of the Python community to our own long-term strategic success. Ultimately
> we benefit from a Python language that is robust, bug-free and as broadly
> supported by the development community as possible. By deepening our
> commitment to Python we can motivate our current development team, while
> also demonstrating to potential future employees that a career with Uniblue
> is a path to more actively participating in the broader Python project.
> Combined, these two vectors will help us build the team we need, while also
> helping Python develop its code and its community.

Becoming a Sponsor

Sponsor members pay annual dues to support the Foundation's activities.
Prospective sponsor members apply for membership to the PSF board. The board
verifies that they meet the criteria set out for sponsor members and then
votes on whether to recommend them for sponsor membership in the next
election. For more information about membership in the Python Software
Foundation, refer to the `Membership FAQ <http://python.org/psf/membership/>`_.
