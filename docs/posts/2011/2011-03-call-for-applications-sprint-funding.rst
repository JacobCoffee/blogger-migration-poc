Call for Applications: Sprint Funding
=====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/call-for-applications-sprint-funding.html>`_.

The PSF Sprints Committee has sent out a call for applications from groups who
want funding to host sprints on Python-related development work.

Sprints Committee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Sprints Committee was `established in June
2010 <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/psf-sponsored-sprints.html>`_ to
encourage and assist groups to come together to work on Python-related
projects. The committee has successfully funded a number of sprints since it
was created, and the PSF Board of Directors has recently set aside additional
funding to be used for sprinting during the upcoming year.

Sprint Topics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sprints on any topic related to Python may qualify for a grant. Groups can
work on any of the interpreters (CPython, PyPy, Jython, IronPython, etc.),
modules from the standard library, third-party libraries, development tools,
or anything else affecting the community.

Sponsored sprints have covered topics including porting Genshi to Python 3,
improvements to packaging as part of the Distribute/distutils project, and
most recently, the `PyPy winter
sprint <http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/02/pypy-winter-sprint-report.html>`_
in Switzerland. Check out the `sprints blog <http://pythonsprints.com/>`_ for
more details.

Assistance
^^^^^^^^^^

The Sprints Committee has prepared guides for `sprinting on Python
core <http://docs.pythonsprints.com/core_development/>`_ and `porting to Python
3 <http://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/>`_ to help make your event
successful. In addition to organizational support, the committee can also
offer financial assistance in the form of grants.

Any sprint group can apply for a grant from to cover expenses directly related
to a sprint event. That includes buying meals, renting meeting space, and
other reasonable expenses. The maximum grant for an event is US$300.

If your group is interested in hosting a sprint, check out the full details of
the `call for applications <http://www.pythonsprints.com/cfa/>`_ at and contact
the Sprints Committee at `sprints@python.org <mailto:sprints@python.org>`_.
