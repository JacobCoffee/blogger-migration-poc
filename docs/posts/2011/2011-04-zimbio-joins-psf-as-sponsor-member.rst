Zimbio Joins the PSF as a Sponsor Member
========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/04/zimbio-joins-psf-as-sponsor-member.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is pleased to welcome
`Zimbio <http://www.zimbio.com/>`_ as a new sponsor member. Zimbio is the online
magazine publisher behind pop culture websites <http://zimbio.com> (covering
entertainment news) and <http://stylebistro.com> (covering fashion). Their
publishing platform and content analysis tools are built in Python.

Danny Khatib gave this explanation for sponsoring the PSF:

> We love Python. We have benefited greatly from its open source nature and we
> have vested professional and personal interests in helping it thrive. For
> technical recruiting purposes, we want to align ourselves more closely with
> the open source technologies we embrace (primarily Python and Django). From
> an awareness perspective, we want to be known as the most technologically
> sophisticated media company on the planet, so engineers will be excited to
> work for us. From a talent perspective, we hope that getting more involved
> with the Python Software Foundation and discussion will enable us to more
> easily identify great talent.

Becoming a Sponsor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sponsor members pay annual dues to support the Foundation's activities.
Prospective sponsor members apply for membership to the PSF board. The board
verifies that they meet the criteria set out for sponsor members and then
votes on whether to recommend them for sponsor membership in the next
election. For more information about membership in the Python Software
Foundation, refer to the `Membership FAQ <http://python.org/psf/membership/>`_.
