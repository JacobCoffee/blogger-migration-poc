About the Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PSF Directors are elected annually and are responsible for managing the
business of the foundation, as outlined in the
`bylaws <http://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/>`_. They fulfill two
responsibilities:

  1. Completing or overseeing administrative tasks related to the legal standing of the Foundation. These include responding to trademark or licensing queries and monitoring the Foundation's financial health.
  2. Completing "special projects" such as `fund raising <http://www.python.org/psf/donations/>`_, `administering grants <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_, and supporting day-to-day operations of the Python community.

A director's specific duties depend on the office and any sub-committee
memberships held. The board meets monthly via IRC. `Minutes from the
meetings <http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/>`_ are available
online. Most Directors are volunteers, although some Officer positions
(Treasurer and Secretary) do receive a nominal salary.
