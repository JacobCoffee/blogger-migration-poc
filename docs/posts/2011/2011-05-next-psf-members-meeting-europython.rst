Next PSF Members Meeting: EuroPython 2011
=========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/05/next-psf-members-meeting-europython.html>`_.

The next official meeting for members of the Python Software Foundation will
be held Tuesday, 21 June 2011 `19:30 CEST (local
time) <http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20110621T1930&p1=215>`_
at `EuroPython <http://ep2011.europython.eu/>`_ in Florence, Italy. The meeting
will take place at the EuroPython conference venue, the `Grand Hotel
Mediterraneo <http://www.fhhotelgroup.it/eng/grand_hotel_mediterraneo/grand_hotel_mediterraneo.htm>`_.
Attendance is expected to be similar to the event as last year in Birmingham,
when 30 PSF members and 8 invited non-members participated.

If you plan to attend, please contact meeting chair Marc-Andr√© Lemburg so we
can estimate the size of the room we will need.

For more details, see the `Members Meeting
Agenda <http://wiki.python.org/psf/MembersAgenda>`_ in the PSF wiki.
