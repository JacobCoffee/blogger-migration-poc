Free Tickets for PyNZ
=====================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/06/free-tickets-for-pynz.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is once again sponsoring an international
conference. This time is the `Kiwi's PyCon 2011 <http://nz.pycon.org/>`_ to be
held on August 27th and 28th at Te Whaea in Wellington, New Zealand.

As a sponsor, the PSF received several passes to the conference, and is
offering them to foundation members or other members of the Python community.
Preference will be given to students or other individuals with financial aid
needs--especially those just getting into Python!

If you wish to take advantage of the tickets or know of someone local, a
student, or someone else who would love to go but can not cover the admission,
contact Jesse Noller (`jnoller@python.org <mailto:jnoller@python.org>`_) or the
PSF board (`psf@python.org <mailto:psf@python.org>`_).
