About the Conference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyTexas 2011 was the fourth annual free Python programming conference in
Texas. It took place Saturday, September 10 - Sunday, September 2011 at the
Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. They have a
`blog <http://blog.pytexas.org/>`_ that has some photos from the conference on
it. All of the talks at PyTexas were recorded and are starting to appear on
`NextDayVideo <http://nextdayvideo.pytexas.org/>`_ and
`Miro <http://python.mirocommunity.org>`_. If you would like to help plan next
year's conference, you can join the PyTexas mailing
`list <http://www.pytexas.org/2011/community/>`_.

They estimate about 170 people attended PyTexas 2011, up from 94 at PyTexas
