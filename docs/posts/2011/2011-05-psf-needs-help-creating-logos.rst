PSF Needs Help Creating Logos
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/05/psf-needs-help-creating-logos.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation board is looking for volunteers to create logos
that can be made available to supporters and members of the PSF. Whether you
are a professional graphics artist or you just enjoy creating artwork, the PSF
would appreciate your contribution.

PSF Member Logos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first set of logos is for members and sponsors of the Foundation. We need
logos for the following support levels, listed in order from lowest to
highest:

  * Supporter of the Python Software Foundation
  * Honorary Associate Member of the Python Software Foundation (HAMs)
  * Sponsor Member of the Python Software Foundation
  * Principal Sponsor of the Python Software Foundation
  * Patron Sponsor of the Python Software Foundation
  * Benefactor Sponsor of the Python Software Foundation
  * Member of the Python Software Foundation

Python Marketing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PSF also needs several other logos for Python 2 and 3 marketing. For
example, a set to identify which version of Python is supported by a piece of
software. There are three combinations:

  * Supports Python 2
  * Supports Python 2 and 3
  * Supports Python 3

Mobile Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Developers occasionally request permission to use the logo for mobile phone
application icons. Ideally, we can establish a standard for these (such as a
square with one line of text below the Python logo).

Logo Variations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PSF trademark committee frequently receives requests for permission to use
modified versions of the standard Python logo. Ideally, all the new logos
should be available in four variations for size and color. Having wide and
tall versions, like the existing "Python powered" logos on the
`website <http://www.python.org/community/logos/>`_, will allow the logo to be
used in different layouts. Versions with and with dark and light backgrounds
will let it to fit into different color schemes.

Submitting a Proposal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Email the PSF board (psf at python dot org) with a URL to your proposal. The
font files for Flux Regular, used in the official Python logo, will be made
available to designers who need them.

The final logos needs to be licensed to the PSF with the option to re-license
to other projects or uses. If your submission is selected, you will be asked
to sign a `contributor agreement <http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-
form-python/>`_.
