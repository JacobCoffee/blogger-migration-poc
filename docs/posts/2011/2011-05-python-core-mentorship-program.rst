The Python Core Mentorship Program
==================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/05/python-core-mentorship-program.html>`_.

`Jesse Noller <http://jessenoller.com/>`_ recently `
announced <http://jessenoller.com/2011/04/05/python-core-mentorship-up-and-
running/>`_ the formation of the _Python Core Mentorship_ program. The idea
behind the program is to help programmers, including students and developers
from other projects, connect with experienced contributors who serve as
mentors to ease them into Python Core development.

Contributors Wanted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mentors will help people regardless of experience level by bringing them
up to speed, answering questions, and giving guidance as needed in a non-
confrontational and welcoming way. The contributors will receive guidance
through the entire contribution process, including discussions on the related
mailing lists, the bug tracker, Mercurial, code reviews, and much more.

Early Success
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The program already has been successful, and the participants have actively
committed a number of patches. There have also been several constructive
discussions on the mailing list, helping guide people in the right direction
for a variety of issues.

Code of Conduct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The program has a code of conduct explained on the
`website <http://pythonmentors.com/>`_ that aims to assuage concerns many new
contributors have when interacting with experienced developers and mailing
lists on contribution in general. Jesse and the other mentors hope that this
program can act as a model for other projects long-term, not just benefiting
Python-Core. They also want the program to help increase the overall diversity
of the contributors to Python.

Signing Up
^^^^^^^^^^

The program is run via the `mailing
list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/core-mentorship>`_ and has a
clear, concise `website <http://pythonmentors.com/>`_ devoted to it. If you
would like to join to ask questions and begin on the path of core
contribution, or even if you are an experienced developer (even experienced in
Python-Core) looking to ask questions you're worried about asking on other
lists, this is an excellent opportunity to jump in, ask and get your feet wet!
