Boston Python Workshop PSF Grant
================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/11/boston-python-workshop-psf-grant.html>`_.

(This is a guest post by Jessica McKellar, a Boston Python User Group
organizer and co-organizer of the Boston Python Workshop for women and their
friends.)  
  
I am thrilled to report that the Python Software Foundation's Outreach and
Education Committee awarded a $3300 grant to the `Boston Python
Workshop <http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/>`_ to support and grow the workshop
over the next 8 months. We are excited to continue our successes at bringing
more women into the Boston Python community and to take the show on the road!

The Boston Python Workshop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Boston Python Workshop is a free, volunteer-driven introduction to the
Python programming language for women and their friends who have no or limited
programming experience. We run the workshop every 2 months for between 30 and
50 women, and it has run 4 times so far. We strive to:  

  * Show new programmers and the `Boston Python <http://bostonpython.com/>`_ community examples of smart, confident, capable programmers of all backgrounds.
  * Bring new, awesome, diverse people into the local Python community through diversity and outreach events.
  * Inspire others to run their own introductory workshops and outreach events, and to get more user groups thinking about diversity and outreach.

An important part of our philosophy is a commitment to running the workshop as
part of the local user group.  
  
This Python Software Foundation grant will help us run the next three
workshops in Boston and bootstrap workshops in 3 new cities. As a result of
this grant:  

  * Over 200 women will learn Python fundamentals and join their local programming communities as empowered, confident beginners who are excited to continue learning.
  * 3 new Python user groups will learn how to run high-quality diversity outreach events.
  * Volunteers at the workshops will get experience with public speaking and teaching technical content -- a great stepping stone to leading future PyCon talks and tutorials!
  * The Python community as a whole will continue to benefit from our shared, online, Creative Commons-licensed workshop material as we expand and refine it.

Results
^^^^^^^

The workshop has resulted in dramatic, lasting diversity improvements for the
Boston Python User Group. Many workshop alums are now fixtures at our hack
nights and lecture-style events, and the group has gone from 0-3% women at its
events to consistently over 15%. Additionally, group membership has doubled
since the workshops started, to over 1350 people, making it the second-largest
Python user group in the US.  
  
If you do the math you'll see that we aren't just bringing women into the user
group through the workshop. The secret is that running beginner-friendly
outreach events for women focuses the group on being more welcoming to
everyone. Our monthly hack nights grew out of the workshop and are one example
of bringing beginner-friendly ideas from the workshop to the group as a whole.
The Boston Python user group is now a more diverse and vibrant community full
of beginners, scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, and people switching to a
career in software/IT, and we're very happy that the workshop has played a
significant role in this.

Beyond Boston
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to help other user groups see the same kinds of successes that we've
had here in Boston, and a large part of this PSF grant is dedicated to
bootstrapping workshops in other cities. If you want to bring the workshop to
your city, `read the full grant
proposal <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/outreach-and-
education/2011-October/000099.html>`_ and `get in
touch <http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/clone-it/>`_!  
  
All of our material is online and shared through a permissive Creative Commons
license. Check out an `example
curriculum <http://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_4>`_ and
`photos <http://www.flickr.com/photos/bostonpythonworkshop/>`_ from the
workshops. Our goal of stress-free experiences for attendees makes our
material a good base for other intro events; for example, we believe our
cross-platform installation instructions for Python are the best we've seen.  
  
We look forward to a larger, more diverse Python community, and we want to
thank the Python Software Foundation for supporting our efforts. The Outreach
and Education Committee, `PSF Grants
program <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_, and `PSF Sprints
program <http://pythonsprints.com/>`_ are all interested in new grant requests
to push the Python world forward. Make something awesome happen in your city!
