GSOC Student Applications Open
==============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/gsoc-student-applications-open.html>`_.

Students who want to participate in the Google Summer of Code project this
year should `apply online
now <http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/python>`_! The deadline
for applications is April 8, but the load on the servers increases as that
date approaches, so apply _now_ to avoid the rush and make sure your
application is received in time.

Google Summer of Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has been sponsoring Google Summer
of Code (GSoC) projects to pair students with mentors from Python-based
projects for real-world development experience. Students who are accepted into
the program will spend the summer working on an open source project in Python,
and be paid US$5,000 if the project is completed.

Projects
^^^^^^^^

In addition to the mentors from the core Python team, several umbrella teams
are already involved with the PSF for GSoC. Details about the proposed project
ideas and prospective mentors can be found on `the
wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2011>`_.

Increasing Diversity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PSF is committed to increasing the diversity of the Python community. One
way we are working toward that goal is by encouraging women and other
minorities to apply to participate in GSoC through one of the PSF-sponsored
projects. The `Mailman <http://www.list.org>`_, `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_,
and `PySoy <http://www.pysoy.org/>`_ projects are especially active in seeking
minority applicants this year.

Important Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Student application deadline: 8 April

Students and Mentors paired up: 22 April

Announce accepted Students: 25 April

For more details about the schedule, see the `GSoC
timeline <http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/timeline>`_
on the project web site.

*Updated:* The original version of this post incorrectly stated that
students could earn US$4,500 instead of US$5,000.
