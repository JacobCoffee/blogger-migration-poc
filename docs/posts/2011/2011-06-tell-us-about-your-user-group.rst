Tell Us About Your User Group
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/06/tell-us-about-your-user-group.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is conducting an international survey of Python
User Group organizers to help us better serve the large and ever-expanding
Python User Group community.

The survey contains questions on user group organization, events,
demographics, and growth. There are some questions with numerical answers, and
while your best guess is fine, you may find it helpful to gather some
statistics on your user group membership before starting the survey (example
statistics include the number of active members and the size and topics for
recent user group events).

We expect this survey to take around 30 minutes to complete. We appreciate
your time and honesty in answering these questions.

This survey was written by `Jessica McKellar <http://jesstess.com>`_, organizer
for the `Boston Python Meetup <http://meetup.bostonpython.com>`_, and `Jesse
Noller <http://jessenoller.com/>`_, PSF board member and PyCon chair.
