Call for submissions for promotional brochure
=============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/call-for-submissions-for-promotional.html>`_.

A new PSF project aims to create professional quality promotional material
about Python. The first goal is to create a brochure to showcase the many ways
Python is used. It will include use cases to highlight the ways the language
allows users to accomplish their tasks both in educational and in professional
settings.

Project team members Marc-André Lemburg, Jan Ulrich Hasecke, and Armin Stross-
Radschinski created this `Plone marketing
brochure <http://www.coactivate.org/projects/plone-marketing/contributed-
marketing-materials/090-729_PloneFolderA4_20091109RZ47lo.pdf>`_ for the German
Zope User Group. It is the inspiration for this new project.

Community feedback and awareness is vitally important for the success of this
initiative, mainly to gather information to be used in the brochure. We are
especially looking for interesting projects that can be discussed as use-
cases.

If you have any suggestions for information to include in the brochure, please
contact Marc-André Lemburg or send an email to brochure AT getpython DOT info.

UPDATE: more information about the brochure, including a newsletter, can be
found `here <http://brochure.getpython.info/>`_.
