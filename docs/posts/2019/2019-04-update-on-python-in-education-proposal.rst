Update on the Python in Education Proposal Phase
================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/04/update-on-python-in-education-proposal.html>`_.

`In January when we launched the Python in Education
project <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/01/python-in-education-request-for-
ideas.html>`_, we were a bit too ambitious with our timeline. Due to other
commitments, we were not able to stick to the original time frame.  
  
Here is the revised timeline:  
  

April 4 - May 9: Request for Proposals phase

May 10 - May 31: Review process

June 1: Notify the accepted proposals

June-August of 2019: Accepted proposal work begins

  

  

We'd also like to take this opportunity to inform everyone interested in
submitting a proposal that we selected three categories we'd like to see
proposals on. Additionally, we'd like to share the evaluation rubric we will
use when reviewing each proposal.

  

Proposal categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After reviewing all of the ideas we received in the first phase of this
project, we have narrowed the scope of the proposals to:

  1. resources (curriculums, evaluations, studies, multidisciplinary projects)
  2. localization (translations, global currency, global timestamps, etc)
  3. mobile (development on mobile devices)

We ask that if you are considering submitting a proposal that it fall into one
of these broad categories.

  

Evaluation rubric
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

  

  

  

Every proposal we receive will be evaluated against this rubric. We are
looking for proposals that adhere to the PSF's code of conduct, align with the
PSF's mission, have international reach, are feasible, and pertain to
underrepresented topics.

  

If anyone has any questions, please contact us at edu-committee@python.org.
