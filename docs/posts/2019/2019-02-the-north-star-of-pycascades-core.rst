The North Star of PyCascades, core Python developer Mariatta Wijaya, receives the 2018 Q3 Community Service Award
=================================================================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html>`_.




We in the Python community have a deep appreciation for the volunteers who
organize, promote, and write the language. A phrase that has become a
cornerstone of our community, afterall, ‚ÄòCome for the language, stay for the
community‚Äô (derived from Python core developer `Brett Cannon‚Äôs opening
remarks <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_LLYTm-QnM>`_ at PyCon 2014), reflects
the passion of our community and more so of the countless volunteers building
our community.

  

One volunteer who has been steadfast in actively building the Python community
- from her contributions to CPython to her work as an organizer and co-chair
of PyCascades 2018 and more - is Mariatta Wijaya. We at the Python Software
Foundation are pleased to name Mariatta Wijaya as a `2018 Q3 Community Service
Award  <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#id3>`_recipient:

  

> _RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the Q3 2018 Community
> Service Award to Mariatta Wijaya for her contributions to CPython, diversity
> efforts for the Python Core Contributor team, and her work on PyCascades._

  

Come talk! The path to becoming a Core Python Developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

At Montreal PyCon 2015, Guido Van Rossum delivered the `closing
keynote <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-uKNd5TSBw>`_ during which Guido
issued a public ask, ‚ÄúI want at least two female Python core developers in the
next year ... and I will try to train them myself if that's what it takes. So
come talk to me." Consequently, Mariatta did just that, she reached out to
Guido after PyCon 2016 to learn more about starting in Python core
development. Mariatta recalls, ‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt contributed to open source [yet] and
I wanted to know how to start‚Äù. Guido recommended some ways for Mariatta to
start including reviewing the `dev
guide <https://devguide.python.org/coredev/>`_, looking at open issues and
joining and introducing herself on the `Python dev mailing
list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev>`_`
 <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev>`_.

  

Following Guido‚Äôs advice, Mariatta ‚Äúread the issues [to] see if there is
anything I can help with, anything that interests me ... [when I learned that]
Brett was starting migration [of Python] to GitHub‚Äù. As an engineer at Zapier,
Mariatta has a background in web development so the migration provided an
initial issue she could begin to explore. Mariatta has since contributed to
several bots that improve the workflows for Python contributors and core
developers, reviewed and merged 700+ PRs to Python, and is Co-Chair of the
Language Summit in 2019 and 2020. Some examples of bots she has written
include `cherry-picker <https://pypi.org/project/cherry-picker/>`_, a ‚Äútool used
to backport CPython changes from master into one or more of the maintenance
branches‚Äù. Additionally, Mariatta is the author of
`PEP-581: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/>`_` Using GitHub Issues for
CPython <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0581/>`_. Her motivations behind
this PEP again come back to improving the core Python development processes,
‚ÄúI think it will be more beneficial to use an out of the box issue tracker
like GitHub as it will allow core developers to focus on developing and
contributing‚Äù.

  

A role model for us all: Increasing the diversity of the Core Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Development team

  

The recent departure of Guido as BDFL and the subsequent discussion about the
future governance of core Python led to several suggestions, with the
`Steering Council <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/>`_ ultimately
becoming the chosen model. Core Python developer `Victor
Stinner <https://twitter.com/VictorStinner?lang=en>`_ along with several others
`nominated Mariatta to the Steering
Council <https://discuss.python.org/t/steering-council-nomination-
mariatta/670>`_. In Victor‚Äôs nomination he explains, ‚ÄúMariatta became the first
woman core developer in Python [in 2017]. She is actively sharing her
experience to encourage people from underrepresented groups to contribute to
Python.‚Äù The work required to become a core developer is laborious yet
Mariatta has continuously gone the extra mile to lead by example and be active
in public outreach. ‚ÄúMariatta is my role model for mentoring and diversity
which is helping a lot to get more people involved in Python,‚Äù Victor adds.
Python core developer and Steering Council member `Carol
Willing <https://twitter.com/WillingCarol?lang=en>`_ echoed this sentiment
sharing, ‚ÄúMariatta works to share Python and its possible uses with others.
Her blend of hard work, enthusiasm, and caring have welcomed many into the
Python Community,‚Äù

  

Mariatta‚Äôs PyCon 2018 talk titled, ‚Äú`What is a Core Python
Developer <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj7eb6TrtI>`_‚Äù is an ideal example
of Mariatta‚Äôs dedication to building a more diverse core Python team.
Beginning with a question, ‚Äúdo you use f‚Äôstrings‚Äù (Mariatta is a known avid
fan of f‚Äôstrings, she even has
`stickers <https://twitter.com/mariatta/status/1051942829516189696>`_ for them)
Mariatta dives into a talk about what the pathway is for core (and
contributing) developers ultimately commenting on the very real, stark gender
imbalance within the core team, ‚ÄúWe have 848 contributors to Python, less than
10 are women. We have `89 core developers, only 2 are
women <https://youtu.be/hhj7eb6TrtI?t=1842>`_ ... This is real but this is also
wrong. This is not the right representation of our community‚Äù.  While this
number is starting to change as more women are promoted to core development
(`Cheryl Sabella‚Äôs promotion this week <https://discuss.python.org/t/vote-to-
promote-cheryl-sabella-as-a-core-developer/862/38>`_ ups the number of women
core developers up to 5 out of 97), Mariatta has continued to be a champion
and advocate for diversity and inclusion in the core development team. Even
the captionist in Mariatta's PyCon 2018 (seen below in tweets) talk captured
their appreciation for Mariatta's dedication.

The North Star of PyCascades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

Outside of her contributions to CPython, Mariatta has been an active organizer
with PyCascades - a regional Python conference now about to kick off its
second conference this week. The `inaugural 2018
conference <https://2018.pycascades.com/>`_, held in Mariatta‚Äôs hometown
Vancouver, Canada, introduced a a single track format with 30 minute talks, no
question and answer, and includes lightning talks. Inspired by the single
track format of Write the Docs and DjangoCon Europe, this format was not only
an easier way to get a new conference off the ground but, as Mariatta
observed, ‚Äúis able to give [speakers] the large audience they deserve‚Äù. This
format also makes it easier for attendees to navigate.

  

Co-Chairing the conference with Mariatta in 2018, `Seb
Vetter <https://twitter.com/elbaschid>`_ remarked, ‚ÄúMariatta has been THE
driving force behind PyCascades in the inaugural year‚Äù. As a co-chair Mariatta
helped respond to many last minute issues such as when, the day before the
conference at 10:00am local time, Guido informed the organizers he was unable
to obtain a visa to travel to speak at PyCascades. Within a few hours, the
team setup for Guido to speak remotely, had sent him a badge, when the team
learned Guido would be able to attend after all! ‚ÄúWhen we found out he's
coming, we printed one more badge for him. That's why he has multiple badges,‚Äù
Mariatta explained. Juggling many changing priorities is the life of an
organizer. Yet each decision made, ‚Äúshe ensured ‚Ä¶ considered the potential
impact on the diversity of the conference,‚Äù Seb remembered adding, ‚Äú[Mariatta]
seems to have an endless stream of enthusiasm and energy and was our North
Star for doing everything we could to make it as inclusive for attendees as
possible‚Äù. The idea of Mariatta acting as a North Star was echoed by
PyCascades organizer `Don Sheu <https://twitter.com/ulysseas?lang=en>`_ adding,
‚Äúshe gives voice to folks that aren‚Äôt sufficiently represented in tech ‚Ä¶ [as a
part of] PyCascades founding team, Mariatta‚Äôs influence is creating a safe
environment‚Äù.

  

With `PyCascades 2019 <https://2019.pycascades.com/>`_ happening in Seattle this
upcoming weekend (February 23 - 24), Mariatta is again contributing as an
organizer.

  

What do f-string stickers and food have in common? Mariatta‚Äôs love of
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
them!

  

Outside of Python, when asked what else Mariatta likes to do she simply
responded, ‚ÄúI love food!‚Äù. And her favorite food? Asian cuisine.
