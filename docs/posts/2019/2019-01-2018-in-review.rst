2018 in review!
===============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/01/2018-in-review.html>`_.

  
Happy New Year from the PSF! We’d like to highlight some of our activities
from 2018 and update the community on the initiatives we are working on.  

  

PyCon 2018
~~~~~~~~~~

  

PyCon 2018 was held in Cleveland, Ohio, US. The conference brought together
3,389 attendees from 41 countries. We awarded $118,543 in financial aid to 143
attendees. In addition to financial aid, the conference continues to offer
childcare for attendees, a newcomer orientation, a PyLadies lunch, and many
more events.  
  
Registration is now open for PyCon 2019:

Community Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

We initiated a Python Software Foundation *Meetups Pro network* at the end
of the year, which supports 37 meetups in 8 countries and further expansion
planned. The Sponsorship model allows the PSF to invite existing groups to the
Meetup Pro network. The organizers no longer pay for the meetup subscription
once they become part of the PSF network. This initiative will save
approximately 32 hours of PSF staff time and 21 hours of meetup organizer
time.

  
To help with transparency, the *PSF launched its first newsletter* in
December! If you’d like to receive our next edition, subscribe here:
<https://www.python.org/psf/newsletter/>. You can read our first edition here:
<https://mailchi.mp/53049c7e2d8b/python-software-foundation-q4-newsletter>  

  

This year we *formalized our fiscal sponsorship program* to better support
mission related projects. The PSF has signed fiscal sponsorship agreements
with 8 groups including Pallets (Flask), PhillyPUG, PuPPy, PyCascades,
PyHawaii, PyMNtos, PyArkansas, and the Python San Diego User Group. Through
this effort, the PSF is able to support these projects by handling their
accounting and admin work so the projects can concentrate on furthering their
goals.  

  

Python Package Index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

Thanks to a generous award from the `Mozilla Open Source Support
program <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/>`_, the all new `Python Package
Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ based on the `warehouse
codebase <https://github.com/pypa/warehouse>`_ rollout was completed in April of
2018.  

  

If you are interested in what the Packaging Group is currently working on,

for-2019.html>.

  

Grants
~~~~~~

  

The Python Ambassador program helps further the PSF's mission with the help of
local Pythonistas.  The goal is to perform local outreach and introduce Python
to areas where it may not exist yet. In March 2018, the board approved
expanding our *Python Ambassador program to include East Africa*. Kato
Joshua and the Afrodjango Initiative have been doing great outreach in
universities in Uganda, Rwanda, and Kenya.

  

In a general overview, $324,000 was paid in grants last year to recipients in
51 different countries. We awarded $59,804 more in grants in 2018 than 2017.
That's a 22.6% increase for global community support.  
  
Here is a chart showing the global grant distribution in 2018:

PSF Staff
~~~~~~~~~

  

In June Ernest W. Durbin III was hired as Director of Infrastructure. Ernest
will be evaluating and strengthening internal systems, supporting and
improving community infrastructure, and developing programs that benefit the
Python community worldwide.  
  
In September, the PSF hired Jackie Augustine as Event Manager. Jackie will be
working with the team on all facets of PyCon and managing several community
resources for regional conferences.  
  
It is with great pleasure that we announce that Ewa Jodlowska will be the
PSF's first Executive Director, starting January 1, 2019. Given her years of
dedicated service to the PSF from event manager to her current position as
Director of Operations, we can think of no one more qualified to fill this
role as the PSF continues to grow and develop.*
