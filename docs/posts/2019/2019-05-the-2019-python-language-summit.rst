The 2019 Python Language Summit
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-2019-python-language-summit.html>`_.

The Python Language Summit is a small gathering of Python language
implementers, both the core developers of CPython and alternative Pythons,
held on the first day of PyCon. The summit features short presentations from
Python developers and community members, followed by longer discussions. The
2019 summit is the first held since Guido van Rossum stepped down as
Benevolent Dictator for Life, replaced by a five-member `Steering
Council <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/>`_.

  

LWN.net covered the proceedings from 2015 to 2018; this year the PSF has
chosen to feature summit coverage on its own blog, written by A. Jesse Jiryu
Davis.
