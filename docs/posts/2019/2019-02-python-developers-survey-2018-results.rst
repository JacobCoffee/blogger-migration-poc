Python Developers Survey 2018 Results: Learn about the community
================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/python-developers-survey-2018-results.html>`_.

In the fall of 2018, the Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains
conducted the official annual Python Developers Survey for the second time.
Much like the `previous survey <https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-
developers-survey-2017/>`_, we set out to identify the latest trends and gather
insight into how the world of Python development looks . Over twenty thousand
developers from more than 150 different countries participated last year to
help us map out an accurate, up-to-date landscape of the Python community.
That is more than twice as many Python users participating in 2018 as in 2017.
We are super-excited to share the results of the survey with you!

 <https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/>`_  
  
We hope the survey findings will help all of us better understand the current
state of the Python developer community, see the big picture, and answer some
potential questions. Find out about the most popular types of Python
development, trending frameworks, libraries and tools, additional languages
used together with Python, adoption rates of different Python versions, and
gain many other insights into the world of Python.  
  
We couldn’t include all the potential findings into the report without
bloating it. If you have specific questions that are unanswered, `send them to
us <mailto:surveys@python.org>`_ and we’ll dig into the data for an answer. Or
if you want to delve into the data yourself, we’re also sharing the `raw
survey data <https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-
survey-2018/#methodology>`_, which anyone can use to arrive at their own
conclusions and additional findings.  
  
We’re excited to see and share your findings! Please share them on twitter or
other social media mentioning `@jetbrains <https://twitter.com/jetbrains>`_‏ and
`@ThePSF <https://twitter.com/ThePSF>`_ with the *#pythondevsurvey* hashtag.
We’re open to any suggestions and feedback related to the survey so we can run
an even better one next time.  
  
Huge thanks to all the participants of the survey and to the amazing team at
PSF and JetBrains that worked hard to make this happen!
