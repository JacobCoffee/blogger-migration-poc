PyPI Security Q4 2019 Request for Information period opens.
===========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/08/pypi-security-q4-2019-request-for.html>`_.

The `Python Software Foundation <https://python.org/psf-landing>`_ `Packaging
Working Group <https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#packaging-work-group>`_
has received funding from `Facebook research <https://research.fb.com/>`_ to
develop and deploy of enhanced security features to PyPI.

`PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ is a foundational component of the
`Python <https://python.org/>`_ ecosystem and broader computer software and
technology landscape. This project aims to improve the security and
accessibility of PyPI for all users worldwide, whether they are direct users
like project maintainers and ``pip
install` <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ers or indirect users. The impact of
this work will be highly visible and improve crucial features of the service.  
  
Specifically, this project aims to implement verifiable cryptographic signing
of artifacts and infrastructure to support automated detection of malicious
uploads to the index.

We plan to begin the project in December 2019. Because of the size of the
project, funding has been allocated to secure one or more contractors to
complete the development, testing, verification, and assist in the rollout of
necessary features.

To receive notification when our Request for Information period closes and the
Request for Proposals period opens, please `register your interest

What is the Request for Information period?
-------------------------------------------

A Request for Information (RFI) is a process intended to allow us (The Python
Software Foundation) and potential contractors to openly share information to
improve the scope and definition of the project at hand. Also, we encourage
stakeholders in the community with expertise in the project areas to
contribute their viewpoints on open questions for the scope of the work.

We hope that it will help potential contractors better understand the work to
be completed and develop better specified proposals. Additionally we have
designed the RFI with an open nature in order to expose the project to
multiple perspectives and help shape the direction for some choices in the
project.

The Request for Information period opens today, August 28, 2019, and is
scheduled to close *September 18, 2019*.

After the RFI period closes, we will use the results of the process to prepare
and open a Request for Proposals to solicit proposals from contractors to
complete the work.
