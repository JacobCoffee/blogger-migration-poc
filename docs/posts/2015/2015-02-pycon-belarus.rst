PyCon Belarus
=============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/pycon-belarus.html>`_.

One function the PSF is happy to do is to send a PSF Director to _PyCons_  in
various parts of the world to give a talk and to provide information about and
encourage membership in the PSF. Last week, PSF Director, David Mertz,
attended _PyCon Belarus_  in Minsk where he spoke about a new Python language
feature _(`Python's (future) type annotation
system(s) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_) _and met many amazing
Python users.

Along with David, the other invited keynote speaker was `Austin
Bingham <https://www.pluralsight.com/author/austin-bingham>`_, originally from
Texas and currently co-owner and founder of `_Sixty North_ <http://sixty-
north.com/about.html>`_ in Stavanger, Norway. Austin spoke on _Python
refactoring with Rope and Traad._

According to David Mertz, having a PSF Director attend and participate at
these conferences "allows us to support the PSF mission, to make new contacts
outside the US, and to promote the new membership model."

The January 31st conference, the first ever held in Belarus, was a one-day
affair that took place at _EventSpace_  located in central Minsk.
Approximately 150 people attended. There were 14 talks, comprising two tracks;
talks were given in either Russian or English. Many speakers and attendees
came from Russia and Ukraine, both of which have had active recent _PyCons_.

In the _PyCon_  tradition, lively lightening talks were a popular feature.
Austin's talk about w _hat the hell super() does behind the scenes_  was
particularly memorable (hint: see Michele Simionato's article `Python 2.3
Method Resolution Order <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/>`_).

One of the corporate sponsors of _PyCon Belarus_  was the Belorussian software
company, `_Wargaming,_ <http://wargaming.com/en/>`_ developer of the hugely
popular online multiplayer game `_World of Tanks_ <https://worldoftanks.com/>`_.
_Wargaming_  employs around 2000 people in Minsk, including 900 software
developers. _Wargaming_  also has offices in several other cities worldwide.
About 90% of _Wargaming's  _codebase is in Python. David Mertz visited at
their invitation and reprised his conference talk. He also discussed
performance concerns and optimization. Specifically, major tools allowing
significant speed-ups include `_PyPy_ <http://pypy.org/>`_ and `_PyPy-
STM_ <http://pypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stm.html>`_,
`_Cython_ <http://cython.org/>`_, `_Numba_ <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_, as well
as plain old C __ extension modules. David's video is available on `You
Tube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SGsx-HZjNo&feature=youtu.be>`_.
