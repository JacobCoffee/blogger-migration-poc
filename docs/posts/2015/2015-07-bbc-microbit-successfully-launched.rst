BBC Micro:bit successfully  launched!
=====================================

July 7, 2015 BBC Microbit

Last March, I wrote about a terrific educational project taking place in the
UK, with which the PSF is proud to be involved (see `PSF
Blogpost <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/bbc-launches-microbit.html>`_). I
am very happy to report today that the BBC micro:bit project has successfully
launched!

The BBC micro:bit release is part of the BBC’s "Make it Digital" initiative,
whose purpose is to prepare a generation for the challenges of a tech-driven
world. The project is a collaboration of 29 partners from industry, education,
and government.

> Key partners include ARM, Microsoft, Samsung, Barclays, Freescale,
> Element14, Lancaster University, Nordic Semiconductor, Technology Will Save
> Us, ScienceScope and the Wellcome Trust.

At the beginning of the school term this September, every year-7 UK student
(11-12 years old) will be given a BBC micro:bit computer. Designed to inspire
creativity, the BBC micro:bit is pocket-sized, versatile, and, most
importantly, easy to use:

The idea, according to Sinead Rocks, head of BBC Learning, is to make using
computers creatively as natural to children as using crayons to experiment
with coloring.

The micro:bit can be programmed via web-based editors capable of using several
programming languages, including Python, Javascript, C++, Microsoft Touch
Develop, and Blocks (a visual language). The user can then save her program,
run it in a simulator, and retrieve it any time to load it onto the BBC
micro:bit.

In addition to internet connectivity, the device can also connect, via five
I/O rings as well as Bluetooth, to other computers and devices, including
Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Kanos, robots, and motors. When connected, it can be
powered off another device, or it can run on its own battery. The micro:bit
also features a compass and an accelerometer.

BBC Learning, along with the project’s partners, are providing educational
resources and tutorials aligned with school curriculum, in an effort to ensure
that teachers are ready when the micro:bits are distributed to students. With
open-sourced specs and plans for a non-profit to oversee further educational
use of the device, the micro:bit’s initial reach is sure to grow. Commercial
development of the device is anticipated by the end of 2015.

The PSF is eager to seize this opportunity to further the use of Python and to
increase programming literacy. According to the BBC,

> The Python Software Foundation will be working with the BBC micro:bit to
> provide a code editor that will help to teach children the Python
> programming language. They will be working with the Python development
> community to produce resources and activities that children can build using
> Python.

I urge Python developers to volunteer for this effort and to get involved in
this wonderful educational initiative. You can read more about this project
