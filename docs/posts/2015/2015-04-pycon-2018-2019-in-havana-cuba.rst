PyCon 2018-2019 in Havana, Cuba!
================================

> _Hi everyone,_

> Basic Member Mary Ann Sushinsky, with Director and Outreach & Education
> Chair David Mertz, to encourage, in a tongue-in-cheek way, more
> international cooperation in the Python world.   _

> _It did this by poking fun at how the governments of various countries have
> hindered events like a hypothetical PyCon Cuba from happening. It touched on
> a political area where sensitivities are often high, and a number of people
> were hurt or offended by the post. That wasn't cool of us, and we
> apologize._

> _The post remains below because we believe in acknowledging our error rather

>
> _One positive thing that came out of this was a better understanding by many

> strengthened our resolve to find ways to do good by them._

> _We very much hope better to aid Cubans in coming to future Python events

> obstacles they have faced in the past and still. Moreover, discussion
> following this post makes us hopeful that a "PyCon Cuba" (under some name)

With great excitement, the PSF wishes to announce the site for the subsequent
two North American PyCons: the beautiful city of Havana, Cuba! Following our
two years in Montréal, and anticipating a great 2016-2017 conference in
Portland, Oregon, PyCon has truly become “PyCon North America.”

With recent easing of travel restrictions from the United States, the
possibility of going to Cuba was immediately embraced by the PSF and PyCon
organizers. At last, we would be able to bring the joy and power of the Python
community and coding skills to a nation that already has a deep understanding
of the values of collaboration over competition, of community over individual
achievement, of free and open availability of knowledge over corporate owned
intellectual property. Not to mention its beautiful climate, palm trees,
beaches, good food, music, and dancing.

As many Python insiders know well, the Castro brothers, Fidel and Raúl, have
long been fans of FLOSS and of Python in particular. According to a
representative of the `Cuban Ministry of Science, Technology, and
Environment <http://mipais.cuba.cu/cat_en.php?idcat=81&idpadre=6&nivel=2>`_,
upon being told that the PSF was looking at Havana as a possible PyCon site,
President Raúl Castro replied:

> Lo práctico gana a la pureza. Los errores nunca deberían dejarse pasar
> silenciosamente. A menos que hayan sido silenciados explícitamente. Frente a
> la ambigüedad, rechaza la tentación de adivinar.

For an American perspective, we asked the Chair of the U.S. Senate
`Subcommittee on Space, Science and
Competitiveness <http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=ScienceandSpace>`_,
Canadian-born Cuban-American Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), about the Python
language, so widely used by NASA and the scientific research he oversees. Cruz
replied through a spokesperson,

> I’ve always stood for the core American principles of Free Enterprise, Free
> Software, and a Free Republic. It heartens me to see the largest conference
> about my favorite programming language held both in the nation of my birth,
> and now in the one where my father was born.

Havana is not new to hosting conferences—in fact many international
organizations convene at such venues as the International Conference Center,
the Catholic University of America, and the University of Havana.
