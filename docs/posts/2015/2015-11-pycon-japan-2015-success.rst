PyCon Japan 2015: A Success
===========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/11/pycon-japan-2015-success.html>`_.

Last month PyCon Japan took place from October 9 - 12th at the Tokyo
International Exchange Center Plaza Heisei. The PSF has recently received a
report from the Chair, Takanori Suzuki, and it appears that the conference was
a great success.

As a bit of background, the first PyCon Japan was held in 2011. The conference
was a one-day affair with talks comprising three tracks. 247 people attended.
Each year since then, PyCon Japan has grown in size and complexity. Last
month’s sold-out conference had 602 attendees, with 80 people attending
tutorials, and more than 50 staying for a fourth day to participate in
Sprints.

There were 43 sponsors. Sponsoring at the "Diamond" level was the Japanese
firm `MonotaRo <http://www.monotaro.com/>`_. Other sponsors included PayPal,
O'Reilly, CodeIQ, JetBrains, Nikkei, and the Japanese online marketplace,
Curama. The PSF was happy to contribute as a "Gold" level sponsor.

There were 32 talks–11 given in English and 21 in Japanese–covering a variety
of topics, including Pandas, Data Analysis, Metrics, Grep, Asyncio,
Translating code into non-English, Erlang, and more.

There were two keynotes–one in English by PSF Fellow, `Hynek
Schlawack <https://hynek.me/about/>`_, entitled `_Beyond Grep: Pragmatic Logging
and Metrics_ <https://speakerdeck.com/hynek/beyond-grep-pycon-jp\>`_); and one
in Japanese by `Haruo Sato <http://b.hatena.ne.jp/nabinno/haruo-sato/>`_,
entitled `_Possibilities of
Python_ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJH8R9_OL8k\>`_), which was also the
theme of the conference.

There was also a panel discussion on Diversity and the Future of the
Community. Due to outreach efforts, the Japanese Python community has become
more diverse – more women are participating in programming, as was clear from
the groups represented on the panel: Moderator, Makabi Love, of `_PyLadies
Tokyo_ <http://tokyo.pyladies.com/>`_ , was joined by representatives from
_RailsGirls, Java Women, Django Girls_ , and _Women Who Code_ in a discussion
about how to increase diversity.Rounding out the conference were a poster
session, jobs fair, lightning talks, and a children’s workshop. An additional
feature of the conference was an official `chat
session <https://gitter.im/pyconjp/pyconjp2015-en>`_, set up in both English and
Japanese for participants to communicate with each other.
