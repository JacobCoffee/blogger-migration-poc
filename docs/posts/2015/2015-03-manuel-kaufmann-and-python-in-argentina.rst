Manuel Kaufmann and Python in Argentina
=======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/manuel-kaufmann-and-python-in-argentina.html>`_.

Several recent blog posts have focused on Python-related and PSF-funded
activities in Africa and the Middle East. But the Python community is truly
global, and it has been exciting to witness its continued growth. New groups
of people are being introduced to Python and to programming so frequently that
it’s difficult to keep up with the news. Not only that, but the scope and
lasting impact of work being accomplished by Pythonistas with very modest
financial assistance from the PSF is astonishing.  
  
One example is the recent work in South America by _`Manuel
Kaufmann <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNQ9O_3ySs8>`__. Manuel’s project is
to promote the use of Python “to solve daily issues for common users." His
choice of Python as the best language to achieve this end is due to his
commitment to "the Software Libre philosophy,” in particular, collaboration
rather than competition, as well as Python's ability "to develop powerful and
complex software in an easy way."  
  

Toward this end, one year ago, Manuel began his own project, spending his own
money and giving his own time, traveling to various South American cities by
car (again, his own), organizing meet-ups, tutorials, sprints, and other
events to spread the word about Python and its potential to solve everyday
problems (see _`Argentina en
Python <http://elblogdehumitos.com.ar/pages/argentina-en-python-en/>`_)_.  
  
This definitely got the PSF's attention, so in January 2015, the PSF awarded
him a $3,000 (USD) grant. With this award, Manuel has been able to continue
his work, conducting events that have established new groups that are
currently expanding further. This ripple effect of a small investment is
something that the PSF has seen over and over again.  
  
On January 17, Resistencia, Argentina was the setting for its first-ever
Python Sprint. It was a fairly low-key affair, held at a pub/restaurant “with
good internet access.” There were approximately 20 attendees (including 4
young women), who were for the most part beginners. After a general
introduction, they broke into 2 work groups, with Manuel leading the
beginners' group (see `Resistencia, Chaco
Sprint <http://elblogdehumitos.com.ar/posts/primer-sprint-de-python-en-
resistencia-chaco/>`_), by guiding them through some introductory materials and
tutorials (e.g., `Learning Python from PyAr's
wiki <http://python.org.ar/AprendiendoPython>`_).

As can happen, momentum built, and the Sprint was followed by a Meet-up on
January 30 to consolidate gains and to begin to build a local community. The
Meet-up's group of 15 spent the time exploring the capabilities of Python,
Brython, Javascript, Django, PHP, OpenStreet Map, and more, in relation to
needed projects, and a new Python community was born (see `Meetup at
Resistencia, Chaco <http://www.meetup.com/Python-NEA/events/219942458/>`_).  
  

The next event in Argentina, the province of Formosa's first official Python
gathering, was held on February 14. According to Manuel, it was a great
success, attended by around 50 people. The day was structured to have more
time for free discussion, which allowed for more interaction and exchange of
ideas. In Manuel’s opinion, this structure really helped to forge and
strengthen the community. The explicit focus on real world applications, with
discussion of a Python/Django software application developed for and currently
in use at Formosa’s Tourist Information Office, was especially compelling and
of great interest to the attendees. See `PyDay
Formosa <http://pyday.forsol.org.ar/>`_ and for pictures, see `PyDay

It looks as though these successes are just the beginning: Manuel has many
more events scheduled:

  * 28 Mar - PyDay at Asunción (`Gran Asunción, Paraguay <http://pyday.pythonpy.org/>`_ and `PyDay Asuncion <http://proyectosbeta.net/2015/03/se-viene-el-pyday-asuncion-2015/>`_); Manuel reports that registration for this event has already exceeded 100 people, after only 3 days of opening. In addition, the event organizers are working to establish a permanent “Python Paraguay” community!

  * 7 May - `PyDay at Apóstoles, Misiones <http://pydayapostoles.info/>`_;

  * 20-22 May - Educational Track for secondary students at SciPy LA 2015, Posadas, Misiones, Argentina (`SciPy LA <http://scipyla.org/conf/2015/>`_ and `Educational Track <http://elblogdehumitos.com.ar/pages/argentina-en-python/track-teen-scipy-la-2015/>`_); and

  * 30 May - PyDay at Encarnación, Itapúa, Paraguay. 

You can learn more and follow Manuel’s project at the links provided and at
`Twitter <https://twitter.com/argenpython>`_. And stay tuned to this blog,
because I plan to cover more of his exciting journey to bring Python, open
source, and coding empowerment to many more South Americans.
