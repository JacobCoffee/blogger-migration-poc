Unicef Pi4Learning
==================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/unicef-pi4learning.html>`_.

I previously posted about a wonderful education program utilizing Raspberry
Pis (`AstroPi <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/raspbery-pis-in-space-
astropi.html>`_). Here’s another one:

Since last May, Unicef has been using Raspberry Pis to educate Syrian children
who have been displaced into Lebanon due to their country’s civil war. The
program, called _Pi4Learning_  was developed by `James Cranwell-
Ward <http://www.raspberrypi.org/tag/james-cranwell-ward/>`_, UNICEF Lebanon
Innovation Lead, and `Eliane Metni <http://www.iearn.org/country/iearn-
lebanon>`_ of the International Education Association.

With approximately 300,000 Syrian school children living as refugees in
Lebanon with no educational resources, Unicef’s Cranwell-Ward sought an
inexpensive, ready-to-go solution that could be implemented in refugee camp
environments. Already a Raspberry Pi enthusiast, he paired the device with
Alex Eames' KickStarer funded `HDMIPi
screens <http://www.raspberrypi.org/unicef-educate-syrian-children-in-
lebanon/>`_. Working with Eliane Metni, who had been piloting Raspberry Pis at
_Dhour El Shweur Public Secondary School in Lebanon_ , they obtained free
Arabic language curriculum from Khan Academy and began providing free classes
to the Syrian children.

The _Pi4L_  program is divided into learning tracks: Core Skills Modules for
ages 6 – 12 (literacy, numeracy, and science, using Khan Academy content);
Technology Applications for ages 5 – 18 (Learning to Code and Coding to
Learn); and Continuing Education and Certification for Teachers.

Each complete computer system costs around $100 and the Khan Academy content
is stored and can be delivered offline. Currently approximately 30,000
refugees are using the program, and the goal is to continue to expand.

Both Cranwell-Ward and Metni are especially excited that the program teaches
kids to code and to become creative participants in an increasingly
technological world community. According to Cranwell-Ward, _“The rate at which
tech is being rolled out into our lives is phenomenal and coding - or the
understanding of technology and how to manipulate it - is going to be a core
component of our lives and our children’s lives moving forward… . “There needs
to be some basic understanding of what technology is, how it can be
manipulated, how we can use it to help ourselves, and not just be a consumer
or slave,”_  quoted from the `The
Guardian <http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/26/syria-children-
learn-to-code-raspberry-pi>`_.

One of the students is 11-year-old Zeinab Al Jusuf. There is a video about her
experiences and the Unicef project at `Unicef
stories <http://www.raspberrypi.org/non-formal-learning-for-syrian-refugees/>`_.

There is also a wealth of information online about this project, so if you’re
at all interested I urge you to read more. For an excellent overview by
Unicef’s Luciano Calestini, see
