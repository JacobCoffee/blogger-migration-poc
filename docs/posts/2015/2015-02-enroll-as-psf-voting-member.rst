Enroll as PSF Voting Member
===========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/enroll-as-psf-voting-member.html>`_.

"Membership has its privileges!"

Since the new PSF bylaws were adopted in 2013, there have been several new
membership categories that allow for voting rights.

Unfortunately it has taken some time for the PSF to devise a form to allow
members to report their eligibility for those categories. We apologize, but
here it is at last: `Voting Membership <http://goo.gl/XBST1o>`_.

We know that many of you have made valuable contributions to the language and
the PSF, so we hope that you will take the next step and claim your right to
vote. Please review the membership criteria at `Membership
Bylaws <https://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/>`_.

And for those of you who are not yet PSF members, we encourage you to join
under the Basic Membership category. All it takes is to sign up here: `PSF
Membership <https://www.python.org/users/membership/>`_.

Thanks to Director David Mertz for the creation of the form and to Directors
Marc-Andr√© Lemburg and Nick Coghlan for their assistance.  
  
Addendum: Just to clarify, if you are already a voting member (e.g., as a PSF
Fellow), there is no need to do anything more. This new form is for Basic
Members who do not as yet have voting rights but who qualify according to the
criteria.
