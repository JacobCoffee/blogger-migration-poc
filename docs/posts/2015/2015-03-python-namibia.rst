Python Namibia
==============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/python-namibia.html>`_.

The second PSF sponsored African conference I want to tell you about is Python
Namibia (only a mere 3500 kilometers or 2175 miles south of Cameroon). The
conference, the first ever held in Namibia, was held Feb 2 – 5, 2015 at the
University of Namibia in the city of Windhoek. The PSF provided funds at the
level of "Gold Sponsorship" that were used to subsidize travel for
international attendees and to purchase a banner.

According to an email to the PSF from organizer `Daniele
Procida <http://python-namibia.org/person/daniele-procida/>`_, “. . . the event
was a success, with 65 attendees for the four days, and was met with huge
enthusiasm by our Namibian hosts. I hope to be back in Namibia next year for
an even bigger event, organised by the newly-established Python community
there.”

The official website `Python Namibia <http://python-namibia.org/news/close/>`_
provides additional information and thanks to the conference's additional
sponsors: Cardiff University in Wales (through its Phoenix Project), The
University of Namibia, and the Django/Python web agency, Divio AG in Zürich.

One of the attendees was the PSF's good friend, the geologist `Carl
Trachte <http://python-namibia.org/news/carl-trachte/>`_, who sums up his
reasons for attending PyCons all around the world as:

_The neat thing about country/regional conferences is that you more frequently
get to talk to developers or tech professionals from that place who don’t
always frequent conferences outside their area. Seeing how Python (and digital
technology in general) is being used in Sub-Saharan Africa (for the
establishment of a wireless network, for example), learning what the average
work day is like for a Pythonista in these parts of the world - those are
things you really can’t get without being there._

The four days of talks, workshops, coding, collaboration and interaction
engendered such enthusiasm and interest that on the last day a group of the
participants self-organized to form `“PyNam, the Python Namibia
Association” <http://www.namibian.com.na/index_print.php?id=23479>`_.

We certainly look forward to more exciting projects and events coming out of
this group.
