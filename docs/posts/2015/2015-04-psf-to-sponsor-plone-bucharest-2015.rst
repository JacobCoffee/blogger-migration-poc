PSF to sponsor Plone Bucharest 2015!
====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/psf-to-sponsor-plone-bucharest-2015.html>`_.

The PSF has been happy to acknowledge and help sponsor the use of Python in
creating terrific Web Development Frameworks. This blog has previously
featured several instances of PSF involvement in Django-related events (see
e.g., `CSA Award to Django Girls <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/psf-
community-service-award-goes-to.html>`_).

There have also been major developments in the world of Plone. For those of
you who don’t know, Plone is an open source Content Management System, written
primarily in Python. It was developed in 1999 by Alexander Limi, Alan Runyan,
and Vidar Andersen, atop the open source Python-based _Zope_  application
server. Its license is held by the non-profit _Plone Foundation_.

According to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plone_\(software\>`_),

> Plone is positioned as an "Enterprise CMS" and is most commonly used for
> intranets and as part of the web presence of large organizations. High-
> profile public sector users include the U.S. Federal Bureau of
> Investigation, Brazilian Government, United Nations, City of Bern
> (Switzerland), New South Wales Government (Australia), and European
> Environment Agency.

Plone’s website highlights its size and scope ("_340 core developers and more
than 300 solution providers in 57 countries… "__),_ versatility _
("__available for all major operating systems… and in more than 40
languages"__),_ and security track record _("__the best … of any major CMS"_).
See `Plone website <https://plone.org/>`_.

This year, the 13th annual Plone conference will be held in Bucharest,
Romania, October 12 - 18. It will mark Romania’s first major Python event, and
the PSF is proud to be a sponsor at the _S ilver Level,_ with a grant of $2000
USD. Check it out at `Plone Bucharest. <http://ploneconf.org./>`_

The conference website also calls attention to Bucharest’s "_eclectic burst of
metropolitan and intellectual ambition_ ," and its "_many attractions,
ecstatic night-life, and immersive underground culture._"

In addition to its successful conferences (last year’s conference, held in
Bristol, UK, featured 42 talks in 3 rooms over 2 days), the Plone community is
well-known as a pioneer in the use of sprints for open source development.
October’s conference will hold Plone’s largest annual sprint at the conference
site, immediately following the 2 days of scheduled talks.  
  
Plone Bucharest certainly sounds like an exciting place to be in October!
