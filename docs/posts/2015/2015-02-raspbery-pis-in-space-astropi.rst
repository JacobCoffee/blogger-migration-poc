Raspberry Pis in Space: AstroPi
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/raspbery-pis-in-space-astropi.html>`_.

_Personal Note: In 2013, I attended my first PyCon in Santa Clara, CA. At the
time, I was a complete novice at programming, but interested both because my
partner had been a Python geek for a long time and because I was embarking on
a new career as a freelance tutor, writer, and educator, and wanted to learn
about the educational potential of the open source tech movement. At the end
of the conference, the announcement of a surprise gift to be given to each
attendee was met with the kind of enthusiastic, almost frenzied joy I have
only seen previously at rock concerts when an unexpected superstar steps onto
the stage to accompany a lesser known headliner (I would give an example here,
but it would certainly date me)._

  

At the 2013 PyCon, each attendee got a `Raspberry
Pi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi>`_—a tiny, adaptable, extremely
affordable ($25-$35 USD), yet very powerful, single-board computer that would
prove to be a catalyst for the spread of computer literacy to young and young-
at-heart people worldwide.

The `Raspberry Pi
Foundation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation>`_ created the
first marketable device in 2011. Their mission, "to promote the study of
computer science and related topics, especially at school level, and to put
the fun back into learning computing” makes them a natural ally of the PSF.
According to PSF Director, Marc-André Lemburg, “The PSF board thinks it's a
great idea to get the PSF and the RPF working together more closely, since we
share similar goals and there's a large overlap in communities, especially on
the education and young coders side.” Furthermore, Raspberry Pis have been
used to teach coding primarily in Scratch and Python, and they are rapidly
gaining in popularity. Currently, over 4.5 million Raspberry Pis have been
produced and shipped.

  

One of the most imaginative and exciting of the RPF's educational programs
currently underway in the UK is a competition that will allow UK primary and
secondary school students a chance to do real scientific research in space.
For the competition, teams of students will devise experiments and/or create
software for Raspberry Pis that will be deployed aboard the International
Space Station by British European Space Agency Astronaut,Tim Peake. The data
collected will be downloaded to the students conducting the winning
experiments.

  

The RPF's and the UK's commitment to teaching computing skills is further
reflected in their providing teaching resources to aid students in creating
their contest submissions. These resources will be further linked to current
teaching curricula in order to enhance education in STEM fields. Funding and
collaboration are coming not only from educational institutions like the `UK
Space Agency <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-space-agency>`_,
`UKspace <http://www.ukspace.org/>`_, `ESERO-UK <http://www.esero.org.uk/>`_ and
`ESA <http://www.esa.int/ESA>`_, but also from UK industry. For more details,

Stay tuned for a future post on another education project involving Raspberry
Pi: UNICEF's Learning Initiative, as well as some info on the newly released,
quad-core, Rasberry Pi 2.
