Correction to Micro:bit post: no internal battery!
==================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/07/correction-to-microbit-post-no-internal.html>`_.

Yesterday's blog post about the BBC Micro:bit requires a brief correction.  
  
I said that it can be run off of another device or from its own battery power.
However, the latest and final version has eliminated the internal watch
battery slot that was featured on the earlier prototype in favor of offering
an external battery pack that can be attached. This was done as a safety
feature, especially given the possibility of 7th year school children having
younger siblings at home (`BBC
News <http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33409311>`_).  
  
My sincere apologies for any inconvenience my mistake may have caused.
