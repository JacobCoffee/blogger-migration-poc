Raspberry Pi 2: Even More Delicious!
====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/raspberry-pi-2-even-more-delicious.html>`_.

For those of you not familiar with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this UK based
educational charity provides fun projects and opportunities for bringing
coding literacy to students in the UK and to learners all over the world. This
blog previously featured two of their projects, `Astro
Pi <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/raspbery-pis-in-space-astropi.html>`_
and `Unicef’s Pi4Learning <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/unicef-
pi4learning.html>`_. There are many more, including _Piper_  which uses the
game, _Minecraft_ , to teach electronics to kids, or the use of Raspberry Pis
on weather balloons to observe and record (from the UK) today’s solar eclipse,
or _Picademy_ , which teaches programming skills to teachers (for these
projects and many more, see `RPF Blog <http://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/>`_).

The one thing these widely-varied projects have in common is that they all
rely on the high-performing, incredibly affordable, versatile, and fun to use
_Raspberry Pi_! First produced for sale by the RP Foundation in 2011, the
device has become hugely popular, with over 5 million in use around the world.
And it just got even better!

The new Raspberry Pi 2 went on sale in February 2015. The reviews have begun
pouring in, and the consensus is that it’s truly great!

Still selling for a mere $35 USD, still the size of a credit card, and of
course still pre-loaded with Python (along with Scratch, Wolfram Mathematica,
and much more), the new Raspberry Pi features increased speed and
functionality over the B and B+ models. With 900MHz, quad-core ARM Cortex-A7
CPU, and 1 full GB of RAM (over model B+’s 512 MB), it’s been benchmarked at
speeds of 6 to almost 10 times faster than the first B model (see `Tao of
MAC <http://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2015/02/07/1200>`_, `PC
World <http://www.pcworld.com/article/2886260/raspberry-pi-2-review-the-
revolutionary-35-micro-pc-supercharged.html>`_).

Its 4-core processor can run all ARM GNU/Linux distributions and the new Pi is
fully compatible with the earlier models. In addition, Windows is poised to
release a version 10 that will work with the Pi, thus increasing its already
broad appeal and versatility (see `Raspberry Pi
2 <http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/>`_).

Features it retains from the previous Model B+ include 4 USB ports, HDMI,
Ethernet, Micro SD, Broadcom VideoCore IV Graphics, and Sound Card outputs via
HDMI and 3.5mm analogue output (see `PC
Pro <http://www.pcpro.co.uk/components/1000356/raspberry-pi-2-review-the-pi-
you-didnt-know-you-wanted>`_).

Currently the ties between the PSF and the RPF are strong, with many
Pythonistas using the Raspberry Pi and many Raspberry Pi projects being done
in Python. We hope more people will take a look at this remarkable tool and
use it to teach Python, spread programming skills, and put computing power in
the hands of anyone who wants it.
