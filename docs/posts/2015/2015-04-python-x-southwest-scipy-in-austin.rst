Python X Southwest: SciPy in Austin!
====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/python-x-southwest-scipy-in-austin.html>`_.

Mark your calendars: SciPy 2015 is coming in July (July 6-12, 2015) to the
fabulous city of Austin, TX. This will be the 14th annual SciPy devoted to
scientific computing with Python, and organizers expect to exceed 500
attendees again this year.

The importance of this conference for scientific computing cannot be
overstated. `Enthought <https://www.enthought.com/>`_, SciPy’s institutional
sponsor, has been joined by many others, including `Microsoft
Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/>`_, `Square Root <http://square-
root.com/>`_, `D E Shaw & Co <https://www.deshawresearch.com/>`_,
`Kitware <http://www.kitware.com/>`_, `PyLadies <http://www.pyladies.com/>`_, and,
of course, the PSF. The PSF, which has funded SciPy in the past, is sponsoring
the conference this year at the Silver Level with a contribution of $3000.
Last year’s SciPy saw sponsorship increase 85% over 2013, a clear indication
that this conference is growing in size, importance, and reach, as is the use
of Python as the premiere language for scientific computing!

The 2015 conference will consist of 2 days of tutorials followed by 3 days of
presentations. Last year, the conference expanded from 2 days to 3 days of
talks, another indication of the explosion of scientific projects being
conducted in Python. The conference will conclude with 2 days of developer
sprints on projects of interest to attendees. The basic schedule is:

  * Tutorials: July 6 - 7, 2015
  * Conference: July 8 - 10, 2015
  * Sprints: July 11 - 12, 2015

This year’s conference will continue its tradition of having fabulous keynote
speakers. Last year, our own PSF Director Nick Coghlan gave a keynote on
`Python Beyond C <http://pyvideo.org/video/2785/python-beyond-cpython-
adventures-in-software-dis>`_. 2015 keynote speakers include:

  * `Wes McKinney <http://vision.cloudera.com/author/wes-mckinney/>`_, Software Engineer, and author of pandas (Python Data Analysis Library) at Cloudera. Wes is also author of the O'Reilly book _Python for Data Analysis_ ;

  * `Jack VanderPlas, PhD <http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/vanderplas/>`_, Director of Research – Physical Sciences eScience Institute, University of Washington;

  * `Chris Wiggins <http://www.columbia.edu/~chw2/>`_, Chief Data Scientist; Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics, The New York Times & Columbia University.

SciPy 2015 will also include two specialized tracks that run parallel to the
general conference: _Python in Data Science_  and _Quantitative Finance and
Computational Social Sciences_.

The venue is the same as last year’s; the AT&T Executive Education and
Conference Center at the University of Texas campus in Austin
(`AT&T <http://www.meetattexas.com/hotel>`_). This location is central and
allows easy access to Austin’s terrific attractions; good food, music, and
dancing (6th Street is _the place to go_ , and don’t forget to eat barbecue
and wear some cowboy boots!).
