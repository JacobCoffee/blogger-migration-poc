Pycon Cameroon
==============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/03/pycon-cameroon.html>`_.

The PSF was delighted to hear recently from the organizers of two Python
conferences held in Africa that we had helped sponsor.

The first of them, Pycon Cameroon, is the subject of this blog. It was held in
December at The Blue Pearl Hotel in the North West Region city of Bamenda.

According to organizer Ngangsia Akumbo, the main purpose of this event was to
generate awareness among young people, "especially to young girls in Nkwen –
Bamenda – Cameroon on the importance of writing code using the python
programming language."

Most of the attendees were brand-new to programming and had never heard of
Python. Many of them did not have their own laptops. Although the event lasted
for one day, its importance and impact as an early response to great need is
huge. Although Cameroon is a nation that provides state-run public education
to children, and the literacy rate is a fairly admirable 71%, these
achievements are undercut by substantial child labor (over 50% of children
work), poverty, and lack of access to health care. In addition, teachers are
disproportionately located in the south, leaving northern schools understaffed
and those students at an educational disadvantage. See
`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon>`_.

The PSF is proud to have been a part of this early outreach effort and hopes
to see a great many more in the future. Thanks so much to the organizers and
presenters.
