Board of Directions Nomination Instructions Update
==================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/04/board-of-directions-nomination.html>`_.

Unfortunately, the Python Wiki has experienced some spamming and vandalism
lately. This may mean that editing the Wiki, including the Directors
nomination page may take a little extra work until we get things sorted out.
This is described on the `Front
Page <https://wiki.python.org/moin/FrontPage#use>`_:  

> Since spamming and vandalism on this wiki has reached a level that is
> starting to require daily intervention, new users are no longer allowed to
> edit pages.  
>  If you want to edit a page and have just signed up, or you find that you
> can no longer edit a page that you could edit before, please write to the
> `pydotorg-www <mailto:pydotorg-www@python.org>`_ mailing list, stating your
> account name and your intended edits and we'll add you to the
> _EditorsGroup_.  
>  Sorry for the inconvenience, but we want to keep this wiki a useful tool
> for the community, while at the same time need to prevent wiki admin burnout
> effects.

Bear with us.  We will continue balancing making the Wiki usable with also
making it resistant to harmful changes by unregistered or malicious users.
Our great thanks go out to Marc-Andr√© Lemburg and the PyDotOrg team who
rescued an almost completely vandalized Wiki using imperfect backups, and
heroic efforts, back in 2013.
