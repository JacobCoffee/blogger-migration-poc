The 2021 Python Language Summit: Welcome, Introductions, Guidelines
===================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-2021-python-language-summit-welcome.html>`_.

As attendees slowly filtered into the virtual event leading up to the official
start time, they were clearly happy to see each other and have the chance to
get together virtually even though PyCon US and the language summit have had
to be remote for two years in a row. Although we would like to see each other
in person again, one benefit of keeping the summit virtual this year was that
more people were able to participate than usual.

Normally, the number of people attending would be small enough that there
would be time for each person to take a moment to introduce themselves to the
group. Since there were more participants than usual this year, `Łukasz
Langa <https://twitter.com/llanga>`_ walked us through a slide deck that had a
page for each of the attendees. It was an international event, with
participants attending from North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the
Middle East, Asia, and Oceania.

After Łukasz finished the introductions, `Ewa
Jodlowska <https://twitter.com/ewa_jodlowska>`_ told us about the `code of
conduct <https://us.pycon.org/2021/about/code-of-conduct/>`_ and the
`procedures <https://us.pycon.org/2021/about/code-of-conduct/attendee-
procedure/>`_ in place to help all participants feel welcome and have a positive
experience.

With the `2021 Python Language
Summit <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/05/the-2021-python-language-
summit.html>`_ off to a good start, we took a group photo and were ready to
launch into the talks!
