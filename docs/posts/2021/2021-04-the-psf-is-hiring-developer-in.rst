The PSF is hiring a Developer-in-Residence to support CPython!
==============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/04/the-psf-is-hiring-developer-in.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is happy to announce the creation of the
Developer-in-Residence role.  
  
The Developer-in-Residence will work full-time for one year to assist CPython
volunteer maintainers and the Steering Council. Areas of responsibility will
include addressing backlog, analytical research to understand the project's
volunteer hours and funding, investigation of project priorities and their
tasks going forward, and begin working on those priorities. An extension
beyond the first year will be based on the documented priorities this role
creates, available funding, and community goals.  
  
Inspired by the Django Fellowship Program's success
(<https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program>), the
position is the result of a 2019 decision by the PSF board to strategically
increase the PSF's focus to support CPython by helping fund the hiring of a
full-time employee. In the early months of 2020, the Python Steering Council
worked on presenting a road map at PyCon US 2020 that would unveil this
support. Little did we know, 2020 held different plans for us all! Regardless
of circumstances, the group put together `a recording outlining the Steering
Council's priorities and how funding full-time support was put on
hold <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX8fGuh4T_o>`_ (the talk is worth checking
out!).  
  
Fast forward approximately a year, we are picking up from where we left off!
Thanks to the `support from sponsors such as
Google <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/02/welcoming-google-as-visionary-
sponsor.html>`_, this effort is funded for one year and moving forward.  
  
The PSF is currently accepting applications for the role. The job post has
been shared with the Python core developers via their mailing list. You can
check the post via `their public
archive <https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-
committers@python.org/thread/QRKY4T7UCFQH4ZUPJT5IXSSIPXNLTCGK/>`_.

  

  
The PSF is a non-profit that supports the Python community using corporate
sponsorships, grants, and donations. Are you interested in sponsoring or
donating to the PSF so it can continue supporting Python and its community?
