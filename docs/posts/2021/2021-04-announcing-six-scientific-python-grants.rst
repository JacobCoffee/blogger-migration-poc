Announcing six scientific Python grants
=======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/04/announcing-six-scientific-python-grants.html>`_.

The Scientific Python Working Group considers funding proposals that advance
the scientific use of Python. In the past `these have most often been
workshops and conferences <https://wiki.python.org/psf/ScientificWG>`_, but we
also fund project improvements and outreach. Recently, we broadened our scope
to include developer sprints.

Our most recent call for proposals has closed, and we are excited to announce
six grants to:

  * `Spyder <https://www.spyder-ide.org/>`_ for the development of online learning content for the Spyder IDE,
  * Nicolas McKibben to implement MRI reconstruction algorithms in `PyGrappa <https://github.com/mckib2/pygrappa/>`_,
  * `The Carpentries <https://carpentries.org/>`_ to improve and maintain their Python curriculum,
  * `Qu4nt <http://qu4nt.com/>`_ for translating the scikit-learn documentation to Spanish,
  * Rosangela Mesquita for documenting common Continuous Integration practices for `PyOceans <https://github.com/pyoceans>`_, and
  * `Blosc <https://blosc.org/>`_ for the development of a Python wrapper for their new C-Blosc2 library.

We look forward to reporting back on these projects in a few months.
