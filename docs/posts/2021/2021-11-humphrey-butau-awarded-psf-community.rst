==================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/11/humphrey-butau-awarded-psf-community.html>`_.

`Humphrey Butau <https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamub/>`_, web developer, PSF
fellow, and PyCon Zimbabwe co-founder was awarded the Python Software
Foundation 2020 Q4 Community Service Award.

> RESOLVED that the Python Software Foundation award the Q4 2020 Community
> Service Award to Humphrey Butau. Humphrey is the co-founder of PyCon
> Zimbabwe and was an early member of the Python community in Harare,
> Zimbabwe. He is a PSF fellow and has been stewarding our local community for
> a number of years. Humphrey is also a great speaker and has given talks at
> many conferences including keynoting DjangoCon Europe, speaking at PyCon
> Namibia and PyCon Italia.

We interviewed Humphrey to learn more about his inspiration and work with the
Python community. We also asked Anna Makarudze, a close associate of Humphrey,
to share more light about Humphrey's community efforts and impact on the
community.

The Origin Story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  
*

*What was your earliest memory of how you got into tech?  *

*  
*

I got into tech as an IT Help Desk Support and Technician. While doing this
job, I started to learn Visual Basic for building applications on my own.  

  

A friend of mine later introduced me to Python in 2010, and I continued to
teach myself programming.

  

I later gave up as I didn't manage to make headway since I was doing these
things on my own, and there were no other peers from whom I could get help if
I got stuck.

  

It was only in 2015 when I got a scholarship for an online Python and Django
course with Treehouse that my coding journey continued in earnest.

  

*What was your earliest involvement with the Python community?*

*  
*

In 2016 Anna Makarudze and I applied for and got financial assistance to
attend PyCon Namibia in Windhoek. Although the financial aid was not enough to
cover all our expenses if we took a flight to Namibia, we overlooked all that
and took the alternative of a bus ride of 30 hours from Harare, Zimbabwe, to
Windhoek, Namibia.

  

Attending PyCon Namibia was more important for the Python community and us in
Zimbabwe at the time. It was an opportunity to learn from the international
Python community.

  

We attended the conference, learned a lot, and met key people active in the
global Python community. I am forever grateful to the organizers of PyCon
Namibia 2016 as I believe it sparked the "Python revolution" in Africa, with
PyCons in Ghana, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and the first PyCon Africa Conference.




The people as a source of inspiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  
*

*What drives and inspires you to volunteer your time and resources to the
PyCon Zimbabwe and the wider Python community?*

*  
*

It is the people!

  

What motivates me is what comes out of meeting people who share the same
interests as me. The conferences, workshops, activities, and events are a huge
platform for sharing information and building oneself career-wise.

  

It is also heartwarming to hear people mention that their attendance at a
Django Girls workshop encouraged them to pursue a career in programming.

  

*How has your involvement within the Python community helped your career?*

*  
*

By being a member of the Python community, I have discovered so many
possibilities that I might have never realized. I have learned a lot from the
events that I have attended, and this has helped me have a clear picture of
various roles that I can pursue.

  

In 2019, I landed my first role as a software developer. I am sure this was
possible through my involvement in the Python community.

  

Coming from being a hobbyist programmer without Computer Science, my employer
was willing to hire and mentor me.

  

*How has Covid affected your work with the Python community, and what steps
are you taking to push the community forward during these trying times?*

*  
*

Before March 2020, we were already facing challenges as a Python community in
Zimbabwe.

  

Covid-19 came and poured cold water on the steps that we were already taking
to address these challenges. For the past one and half years, we put aside
plans to hold in-person events as we put the health and well-being of members
of our Python community first.

  

We are currently discussing plans for holding virtual events and the
improvement of the Covid-19 situation in Zimbabwe. We hope to get back to
hybrid events in 2022.




Impact story by Anna Makarudze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

As early as 2015, Humphrey had the vision to start a Python community in
Zimbabwe to raise awareness for Python, a relatively new programming language
in Zimbabwe.

  

It is because of Humphrey's leadership that we were able to bring PyCon to
Zimbabwe.

  

Many of our community members, including myself, are working remotely due to
Humphrey's work.

  

I also got involved in community work like speaking at DjangoCon Europe and
DjangoCon US, running PyLadies Harare for a few years, and becoming Django
Software Foundation president because of Humphrey's work.

  

There is no doubt that many of us in Zimbabwe are in the global Python/Django
community because of Humphrey's vision of starting a community in Zimbabwe.

  

The Python Software Foundation congratulates and celebrates Humphrey Butau.
