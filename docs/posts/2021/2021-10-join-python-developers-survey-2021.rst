Join the Python Developers Survey 2021: Share and learn about the community
===========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/10/join-python-developers-survey-2021.html>`_.

This year we are conducting the fifth iteration of the official *Python
Developers Survey*. The goal is to capture the current state of the language
and the ecosystem around it. By comparing the results with last year's, we can
identify and share with everyone the hottest trends in the Python community
and the key insights into them.

In 2020, more than 28,000 Python users from 150 countries participated and
shared with us how they use the language.

We encourage you to contribute to our community's knowledge. The survey should
only take you about *10-15 minutes* to complete.

Contribute to the `Python Developers Survey
2021 <https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c1-python-developers-survey-2021>`_.

This year we have added questions that will help the CPython Developer-in-
Residence and the Python Packaging Project Manager prioritize their work based
on community feedback.

The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation
and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated
results and randomly choose 20 winners (among those who complete the survey in
its entirety), who will each receive a *$100 Amazon Gift Card* or a local
equivalent.
