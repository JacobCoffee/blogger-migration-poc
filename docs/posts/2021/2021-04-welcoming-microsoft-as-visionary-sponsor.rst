Welcoming Microsoft as a Visionary Sponsor
==========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/04/welcoming-microsoft-as-visionary-sponsor.html>`_.

Microsoft helps millions of Python developers achieve more by enabling Python
support across products and services like Windows, Visual Studio Code, GitHub,
and Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft has been a long-time supporter of the Python Software Foundation,
starting in 2006. Today, Microsoft employs several core developers working
part-time on CPython and the Python Steering Council, making significant
contributions as PEP authors. We are also excited that Guido van Rossum has
recently joined Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer and is exploring
performance improvements to CPython.

Aside from helping advance the Python tooling and ecosystem, Microsoft has
shown strong involvement with the Python community and has been a long-time
sponsor of PyCon US, including four years at the top tier Keystone level.
Microsoft’s support for the community extends to sponsorships of regional and
international Python events including in emerging regions.

This year, we are excited that Microsoft is increasing their contributions to
the PSF even further as a Visionary Sponsor. Microsoft’s sponsorship funds
will be used to support the PSF with a focus on working with the Packaging
Working Group on improving PyPI and the packaging ecosystem.

You can read more about how Microsoft is supporting and contributing to the
Python ecosystem on `here <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/supporting-
the-python-community>`_.
