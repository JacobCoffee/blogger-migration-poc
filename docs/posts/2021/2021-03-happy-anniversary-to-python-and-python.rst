For two decades the PSF has worked on:

  * diversity and inclusion efforts
  * establishing and enforcing a code of conduct for our community
  * making PyCon more accessible
  * improving the services we provide to the community 
  * increasing our support of developers and volunteers
  * supporting Python conferences, workshops, and other events around the world.

As we celebrate the PSF’s 20th and Python’s 30th anniversaries, we want to
welcome everyone to become a PSF member. It’s important to us to have a
membership that reflects our community. We want our community to be more
diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you. We are
working to support a community that is based on mutual respect, acceptance,
and encouragement.

Everyone who uses and supports Python is invited to join us at any of the
following membership levels:

Basic Member - it’s free!

Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community. In 2014, we
