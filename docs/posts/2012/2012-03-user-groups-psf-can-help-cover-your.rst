User groups: the PSF can help cover your meetup.com fees
========================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/03/user-groups-psf-can-help-cover-your.html>`_.

Did you know that the PSF has a budget to cover Python user groups'
`meetup.com <http://meetup.com/>`_ fees?  
Well, we do! The PSF can:  

  * reimburse user group organizers for fees paid to meetup.com in the past year
  * prepay annual fees for meetup.com Python groups

You can read the comments on the proposal that established this budget in the
`PSF board meeting minutes from April,
2009 <http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/2009-04-13/#psf-
prepayment-and-reimbursement-of-meetup-com-fees>`_. To get a grant to cover your
user group's meetup.com fees, please `submit a
proposal <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_ to
`psf@python.org <mailto:psf@python.org>`_.

Here is a sample proposal:  

> *Grant Proposal* : $144 to cover the cost of the Boston Python user
> group’s meetup.com subscription for six months: January through December of
> 2012.  
>  *Grant Objective* : Fund the use of meetup.com for organizing and
> managing the Boston Python user group for a 12 month period. meetup.com
> helps to increase the visibility of the user group, as well as boost
> attendance through automated reminders, RSVP functionality, and other tools.
> It also makes organizing and promoting the group easier, as well as
> providing a platform to garner sponsorships and thank sponsors publicly.  
>  *Grant Size* : $144 total, which is the cost of 12 months to organize a
> group on meetup.com.  
>  *Grant Beneficiaries* : The Boston Python user group has over 1500
> members on meetup.com. We have had monthly meetings since before 2007 and
> have an average attendance of 60-100 Python programmers. meetup.com provides
> a centralized location where our members see what’s coming up and who has
> RSVPed for the meeting. Members can also leave comments about the group
> itself.  
>  This subscription will also benefit Python programmers who may not yet know
> about the group by providing highly visible insight into what we do and why
> they may want to join. meetup.com is a well-known site for people looking
> for like-minded individuals, providing us good visibility for new members.
> It also cross-promotes groups to each other, encouraging members of other
> tech groups to consider joining ours. We get several new members each month
> who find us on meetup.com.  
>  *Preferred method of funds delivery* : A deposit into the PayPal account
> for `meetup@bostonpython.com <mailto:meetup@bostonpython.com>`_.

*Q* : My user group uses a site other than meetup.com to advertise events.
Can we still get reimbursed?

*A* : The April 2009 proposal is specifically for meetup.com fees, but you
are still encouraged to submit a general `grant
proposal <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_ for a particular expense to
`psf@python.org <mailto:psf@python.org>`_.

*Q* : How else can the PSF help my user group financially?

*A* : You can apply for a grant through the `PSF Grants
program <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_.
