PSF Sponsors Upcoming International Python Conferences
======================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/06/psf-sponsors-upcoming-international.html>`_.

  

The Python Software Foundation is happy to announce the sponsorship of five
upcoming Python related conferences all over the world. The PSF donated EUR
3500 to `EuroPython  <https://ep2012.europython.eu/>`_ which is being held in
Florence, Italy this year from July 2-8. Next on the calendar is `PyCon
Australia 2012 <2012.pycon-au.org>`_, which the PSF granted AUD $1500 . The
Pythoneers down under will be in Hobart, Tasmania on August 18th through the
19th. The PSF gave NZD 1000 to `Kiwi PyCon <http://nz.pycon.org/>`_ which is
being held September 1-2 in Dunedin, New Zealand. `PyCon
Argentina <http://ar.pycon.org/2012>`_ received USD $3000 in funding this year.
They will be holding their conference in Buenos Aires starting November 12th
and running through the 17th. Finally PythonBrazil also received USD $3000 in
funding and will be holding their conference November 21-24 in Rio de Janerio.

If you're in the area or in the mood for travel and you want to learn some
Python or just meet some of the international Python people, this year is a
good one. You can travel to scenic Italy for EuroPython, head down to
Australia for their exotic animals and then take a boat over to New Zealand
for Kiwi PyCon. When it starts getting cold outside, you can head down to
South America and spend a couple weeks learning Python in Argentina and
Brazil. Can you think of a better way to get out of the cold?
