Antoine Pitrou chosen for Q4 Community Service Award
====================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/12/antoine-pitrou-chosen-for-q4-community.html>`_.

*On December 19, the Python Software Foundation’s board voted to present
Antoine Pitrou with a Community Service Award for the fourth quarter of 2012.  
  
Antoine has been a prolific CPython contributor throughout his more than five
years of work, with his efforts reaching many areas of the code. His
`improvements to CPython’s global interpreter
lock <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2009-October/093321.html>`_,
or GIL, in the fall of 2009 caught a lot of attention around the web. He was
also a major contributor to Python 3’s I/O system for the 3.0 release, and his
recent work on `PEP 3151 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3151/>`_ to rework
the OS and IO exception hierarchy was shipped in the 3.3 release.  
  
His activity extends throughout the codebase and development process, where
he’s active in bug triage and spends time in IRC. On top of the over 3000
commits made by Antoine since gaining access in June 2008, making him the
seventh most active committer, he has been involved in several parts of the
python.org infrastructure, including CPython’s
`buildbot <http://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/>`_ system.  
  
The Python Software Foundation and Python community thanks Antoine for his
consistent efforts and excellent contributions!*
