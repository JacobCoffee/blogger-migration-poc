The award was presented at the first` PyCon South
Africa <http://za.pycon.org/>`_ in Cape Town, of which Simon is the lead
organizer. Simon and team were able to start from the ground up and build a
solid conference with a very nice
`schedule <http://za.pycon.org/schedule.html>`_, including many of the
community’s best speakers. They even brought in ten sponsors to help keep the
conference costs low, including the PSF.  
  
Simon is also a leader in the `Cape Town Python User
Group <http://www.ctpug.org.za/>`_, a group which often meets to discuss hot
topics in the Python world. Along with talks, the group has been getting
together to hack on projects they all use. In 2010 and 2011, the PSF sponsored
sprints lead by Simon and crew to port
`matplotlib <http://pythonsprints.com/2011/04/8/matplotlib-python-3-thanks-
cape-town-group/>`_ and `Genshi <http://pythonsprints.com/2010/09/17/genshi-
python-3-sprint/>`_ to Python 3. The matplotlib code was merged but not yet
released by the project, and Genshi has been available on Python 3 since
shortly after their sprint.  
  
Simon’s efforts also extend around the Python community, where he’s a
maintainer of Genshi and contributes to PyPy, among other projects.  
  
The PSF wishes to thank Simon for his efforts with PyCon ZA and everything
else he does for the Python community.*
