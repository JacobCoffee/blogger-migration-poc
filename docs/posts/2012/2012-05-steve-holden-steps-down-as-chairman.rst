Steve Holden steps down as Chairman
===================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/05/steve-holden-steps-down-as-chairman.html>`_.

Throughout his time with the Python Software Foundation, starting as the
informal chair of the first several PyCons, the Python community has enjoyed
the friendly face of Steve Holden at the helm and around the community,
exemplifying the open source ethos. Through his 8 years as a Director, two of
which he spent as Vice Chairman, and the last four spent as Chairman of the
Board, Steve's hard work and countless hours of effort have helped shape this
community and foundation into the great state we have in 2012.  
  
While Steve isn't leaving the community or even the foundation, where he'll
remain as a Director, he's moving on from the Chairman position earlier than
planned to take some well needed personal time. As he outlines in his last
post, `Swan Song <http://holdenweb.blogspot.com/2012/05/well-i-dont-really-
know-where-to-begin.html>`_, there's likely to be some surgery in his future,
and we wish him all the best.  
  
On behalf of the foundation and the community, we want to thank Steve for
everything he's done for us personally and for everything he's done for the
Python community.
