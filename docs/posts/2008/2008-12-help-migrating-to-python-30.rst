Help Migrating to Python 3.0
============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/12/help-migrating-to-python-30.html>`_.

To assist those wanting to migrate their code to Python 3.0 the developers
have just `announced <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-
dev/2008-December/083951.html>`_ the creation of the `Python-
porting <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-porting>`_ mailing list.
Signing up for the list is a good way to tap in to the advice of the core
developers, so it's probably a good list even if you only want to lurk to
begin with.

Remember that it may take a while for all your project's dependencies to
migrate to the new environment, but it's available now, so fill your boots!
