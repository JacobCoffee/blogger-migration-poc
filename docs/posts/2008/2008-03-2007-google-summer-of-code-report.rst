2007 Google Summer of Code report
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/03/2007-google-summer-of-code-report.html>`_.

`Report on the Python Software Foundation's participation in the 2007 Google
Summer of Code <http://www.python.org/psf/reports/gsoc-2007/>`_

With the 2008 Google Summer of Code just around the bend, we present this
report. James Tauber was the PSF administrator for the 2007 Google Summer of
Code. James and I are both to blame for the lateness of this report, although
me much more than he (I've been sitting on it since December). Better late
than never!
