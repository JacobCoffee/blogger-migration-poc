Martin von Löwis Receives 2008 Frank Willison Award
===================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/07/martin-von-lwis-receives-2008-frank.html>`_.

Yesterday at OSCON I had the pleasure of announcing the 2008 Frank Willison
award. This was instituted by O'Reilly in memory of their editor in chief,
whose "`Frankly Speaking <http://oreilly.com/frank/>`_" column was a regular joy
on the web: guaranteed to entertain and inform. Frank was a great supporter of
Python, and a believer in the value of communities.

Martin von Löwis continues to be a tireless worker on behalf of the Python
community. He has been a long-term contributor to the Python core, and
regularly answers questions on both the python-dev list and the
comp.lang.python newsgroup. A PSF director since 2002 he was also the prime
mover in transitioning the Python development infrastructure from SourceForge,
and has created several Roundup issue trackers for various areas. He chaired
the PSF grants committee, which among other achievements kept Jython alive
when its future looked uncertain. I could go on, but you get the idea: when
something needs doing, he rarely hesitates to step up to the plate.

Martin has, until today, been one of our unsung heroes. I hope all readers
will join me in congratulating him on this well-deserved award.
