Call for bids for PyCon 2010
============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/03/call-for-bids-for-pycon-2010.html>`_.

Over on the PyCon blog Ted Pollari just posted `"So you want to host PyCon
2010..." <http://pycon.blogspot.com/2008/03/so-you-want-to-host-
pycon-2010.html>`_. It's an announcement of the opening of a call for bids, and
a summary of the process (`full PyCon Bid Guidelines
here <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyConPlanning/BidRequirements>`_).
