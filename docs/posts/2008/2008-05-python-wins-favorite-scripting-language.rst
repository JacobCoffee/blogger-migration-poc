Python Wins "Favorite Scripting Language" Award
===============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/05/python-wins-favorite-scripting-language.html>`_.

May 1, 2008 Linux Journal announced their 2008 `Readers' Choice
Awards <http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10065>`_ today, and we are happy to
say that Python won the Favorite Scripting Language category with 28.9% of the
vote. PHP, Bash and Perl (in that order) won honorable mentions. Thanks to
everyone who took the time to register their votes. Python's popularity does
seem to be climbing this year, as attendance at the recent Chicago PyCon
confirmed with a 77% increase in attendance. Let's hope that leads to career
opportunities for Python users!
