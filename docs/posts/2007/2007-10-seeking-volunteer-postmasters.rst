Seeking volunteer postmasters
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/10/seeking-volunteer-postmasters.html>`_.

The group of volunteers that handles python.org email needs help. This
involves responding to post master email messages, moderating and managing
some Mailman lists, and administrating the Postfix installation.

If you have experience with Mailman and/or Postfix and would like to help,
please contact sdeibel at python dot org. Because of the nature of this job,
please also include some references -- it's best if you're already known
within the Python community.
