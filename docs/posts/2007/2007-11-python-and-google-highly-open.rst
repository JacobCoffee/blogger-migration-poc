Python and the Google Highly Open Participation Contest
=======================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/11/python-and-google-highly-open.html>`_.

We are happy to announce that the Python Software Foundation is part of a new
Google Open Source program, the Highly Open Participation Contest. This
contest is an effort by Google to engage pre-college students in open source
programming: Google is offering prizes and awards for completing a variety of
tasks for several organizations.

You can read about the overall `Google Highly Open Participation
Contest <http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8>`_, and see `Python's
GHOP project page <http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-
psf/>`_.

Pythonistas interested in helping can both suggest more tasks and help mentor
participants. Instructions for doing both are available on the project Wiki
under `NewTaskGuidelines <http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-
participation-psf/wiki/NewTaskGuidelines>`_ and
`MentorPage <http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-
psf/wiki/MentorPage>`_.

A large cast was involved in coming up with the tasks, including Brett Cannon,
Collin Winter, Michal Kwiatkowski, Grig Gheorghiu, Greg Wilson, Terry Peppers,
Shannon Behrens, Michael Carter, Phil Hassey, and Michael Mol. We would
especially like to thank Georg Brandl, Titus Brown, Will Guaraldi, Doug
Hellmann, and Andre Roberge for writing up the tasks and creating the project
wiki.

Leslie Hawthorn at Google is the contact for this program, and we would like
to thank her and Google for inviting the PSF to take part!
