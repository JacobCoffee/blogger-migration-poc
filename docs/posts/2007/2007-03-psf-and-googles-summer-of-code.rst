PSF and Google's Summer of Code
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/03/psf-and-googles-summer-of-code.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation is again participating in Google's Summer of
Code; students can apply for funding to work on projects over the summer, and
be paired with an experienced mentor who will provide advice and guidance.
`James Tauber <http://www.jtauber.com>`_ is the PSF's coordinator for the Summer
of Code.

This year, the PSF is reserving a certain number of slots for projects related
to CPython or Jython.

If you'd like to apply as a student participant, please see the wiki page
`wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode>`_
for more information, including project ideas, the list of mentors, and
instructions and tips on how to apply.
