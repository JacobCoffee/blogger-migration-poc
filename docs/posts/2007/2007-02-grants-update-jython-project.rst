Grants Update: Jython Project
=============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/02/grants-update-jython-project.html>`_.

In 2004, the PSF selected `three grant proposals to
fund <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_. One of them, "Moving Jython
Forward", was only partially completed by Brian Zimmer due to a job change.
Some time later, Frank Wierzbicki offered to take over maintenance of the
Jython project, but he found that he had under-estimated the amount of work
necessary when taking over the proposal from Brian, and he did not make as
much progress as he had wanted to.

Martin von LÃ¶wis, the Grants Committee chair, has since discussed this project
with Frank, and they agreed to cancel the remaining grant funding, as there
was likely no chance to achieve the planned goals any time soon.

`Jython <http://www.jython.org>`_ itself, an implementation of Python written in
Java, is still very much worth supporting, and Andrew Kuchling has put support
for Jython on his agenda. The PSF will continue to support Jython going
forward.
