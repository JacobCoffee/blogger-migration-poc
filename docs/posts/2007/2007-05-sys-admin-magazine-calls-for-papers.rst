Sys Admin Magazine Calls for Papers
===================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2007/05/sys-admin-magazine-calls-for-papers.html>`_.

Have you used Python to improve your life as a system administrator? (Yes,
even system administrators are supposed to have lives). If so then Sys Admin
magazine would like you to `write an
article <http://www.samag.com/ed/call.htm>`_., and this year's December issue
has scripting as its theme. The required lead time for print publications is
longer than you might anticipate - see their `editorial
calendar <http://www.samag.com/ed/calendar.htm>`_, and you should also check
their `author guidelines <http://www.samag.com/ed/>`_ \- so we are publishing
this notice early enough to allow plenty of time for planning and writing.
Let's see lots of Python articles in that issue. Fame and fortune await you,
not to mention the gratitude of your fellow Pythonistas! We understand that
the magazine does pay for published articles, but you should agree payment
terms and amount with them in advance.
