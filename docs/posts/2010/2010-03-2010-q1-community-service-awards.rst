2010 Q1 Community Service Awards
================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/03/2010-q1-community-service-awards.html>`_.

The PSF Board chose in the first quarter of this year to honor two individuals
who have both given outstanding service to PyCon. For the first time framed
certificates were actually presented to the recipients in person at the
conference.  
  
Ken Whitesell has been a PyCon supporter for a very long time. It's hard to
remember a time when Ken wasn't working behind the reception desk to make sure
that delegates received all the help they need. Ken has also done sterling
work in presenting many tutorials at PyCon, and has evangelized Python to the
commercial world over a long period.  
  
Yarko Tymciurak has provided several years meritorious service in developing
and maintaining electronic registration and payment systems for PyCon. He has
also shown exceptional dedication to providing high levels of customer service
to both delegates and sponsors, going above and beyond the call of duty in
assisting with registration issues.  
  
Many thanks to both Ken and Yarko. We hope to see you both at PyCon again next
year.
