New Sponsor Member
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the nominated members, a new sponsor member,
`Exoweb <http://www.exoweb.net/en/>`_, was approved. Sponsor members are also
nominated and voted by the PSF's current members, but they have to pay a
yearly fee to the Foundation.

Exoweb has been pro-active in helping the PSF to ensure the
`python.cn <http://python.cn/>`_ domain and `Facebook
page <http://www.facebook.com/#!/pythonlang>`_ are properly managed. Also, the
company hosts the Chinese Python bulletin-board and is well known among the
Asia-Pacific Python community. Internally, Exoweb takes advantage of Python
capabilities on various systems for sys-admin scripting and uses Django and
Twisted in their product pipeline. The main reasons they adopted Python are
the ease of use, excellent performance, and development optimizations.
