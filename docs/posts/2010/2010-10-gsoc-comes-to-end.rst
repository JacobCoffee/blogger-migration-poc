GSoC Comes to an End
====================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/10/gsoc-comes-to-end.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation supported many Google Summer of Code
(`GSoC <http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/program/home/google/

gsoc2010>`_) Projects this year by recruiting mentors and supporting projects
from around the community. As the summer comes to a close, we thought it would
be a good idea to let you know how things turned out, so we contacted a few of
the participants to ask them about their experience.

pip
^^^

Carl Meyer from the `pip <http://hg.io/ianb/pip/wiki/Goo

gle_Summer_Of_Codeorhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ project told us that "the
primary goals for the summer were setting up a continuous integration server
for pip, speeding up the tests and making them runnable without network
access, and porting pip to Python 3. The first and last got done fully, the
middle one mostly done. And Hugo Lopes Tavares closed a number of
miscellaneous tickets along the way as well."

Carl also told us that he enjoyed being a mentor for the project. Hugo went on
to join Globo.com when GSoC was over and thinks that his experience with GSoC
helped him get hired.

rpy2
^^^^

Laurent Gautier of the `rpy2 <http://rpy.sourceforge.net/

rpy2.html>`_ project also enjoyed being a mentor. His project was to get rpy2
compatible with Python 3 on the C-level and to do some custom R graphical
devices with rpy2. They were able to complete their project.

IPython
^^^^^^^

Fernando Perez was the mentor for the `IPython <http://githu

b.com/omazapa/ipython/>`_ work done by Omar Andr√©s Zapata Mesa and Gerardo
Gutierrez. They worked on separate but related projects that dealt with a
multi-process model of kernel hosting for IPython and some client software
using the ZeroMQ messaging library.

You can check out the code at <http://github.com/omazapa/ipython/> and `

km <http://github.com/muzgash/ipython/tree/ipythonqt-km>`_

sympy
^^^^^

The folks at `sympy <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/G

SoC2010>`_ went all out and posted all their GSoC information
`online <http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/GSoC2010>`_. Their projects are
well detailed, and they're very technical. Be brave and read them anyway!

PyGame
^^^^^^

Julian Habrock, the student for the `PyGame <http://pygamed

raw.wordpress.com/>`_ project, `posted his work as he did it on a
blog <http://pygame

draw.wordpress.com/>`_. He worked on a new draw module for pygame and pygame2
with mentor, Marcus Von Appen. Julian thought the project was fun and he
learned how to organize bigger projects and encourages other studentswho have
the time and motivation to join GSoC next year.

Tell Us About Your Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let us know what your project did this summer! The Google Summer of Code
website `lists many Python-related
projects <http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home

/google/gsoc2010/python>`_, but the level of detail online is inconsistent. If
you would like to let us know what your project accomplished, please send an
email to mike _at_ pythonlibrary _dot_ org.
