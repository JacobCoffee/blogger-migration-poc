Montréal-Python Packaging Sprint
================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/07/montreal-python-packaging-sprint.html>`_.

The `Montréal-Python <http://montrealpython.org/>`_ user group is holding a
sprint to work on the Python packaging system Monday July 5, 2010.

Montréal-Python has been sprinting together since November 2009, and this will
be the fifth in a series of sprints on packaging the group has held since
March 2010. The goals for this week are being coordinated with Tarek Ziadé and
the other developers from the team working on
`Distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`_ and
`distutils2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Distutils2>`_, the new packaging
libraries for Python. Returning participants will resume work that was begun
at the previous meetings, and new sprinters will be given assistance learning
their way around the code and configuring a development environment.

The sprint will be held at `Brasseurs Numériques <http://ajah.ca/blog/>`_, 1124
