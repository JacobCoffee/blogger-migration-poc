Members&#39; Meeting at EuroPython 2010
=======================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/members-meeting-at-europython-2010.html>`_.

The PSF is organizing a second members' meeting this year, and the first ever
held outside of the United States.

In the past, official meetings of the members of the Foundation have been held
at `PyCon US <http://us.pycon.org/>`_. This summer, a meeting is being organized
for 19:00 GMT+1/BST Monday, July 19 to be held in conjunction with
`EuroPython <http://www.europython.eu/>`_ in Birmingham, UK.

An `agenda for the meeting <http://wiki.python.org/psf/MembersAgenda>`_ is being
prepared online. It currently includes proposals for increasing the presence
of the Python Software Foundation in Europe through a partner network and/or
branch of the Foundation. As with the meeting in February, official voting on
resolutions put forward will take place online a short time after the in-
person event.

The meeting is open to all PSF members, not just those from Europe. If you
plan to attend, please contact Marc-Andr√© Lemburg so he can make sure a large
enough room is reserved.
