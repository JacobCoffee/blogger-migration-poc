Connect with the PSF on Twitter
===============================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/06/connect-with-psf-on-twitter.html>`_.

If your Python user group, conference, or major project has a Twitter account,
send a message to `@ThePSF <http://twitter.com/ThePSF>`_ so we can follow you
and help spread your news.

`![Follow ThePSF on Twitter <http://twitter-
badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-c.png>`_](http://www.twitter.com/ThePSF)

*Updated* : We want to follow your _user group_ on twitter. There are just
too many individuals to make following one at a time realistic. Sorry for the
confusion!
