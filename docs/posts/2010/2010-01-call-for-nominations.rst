Call for Board Nominations
==========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/01/call-for-nominations.html>`_.

Under the `PSF bylaws <http://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/>`_, in order to become
a voting member you must be nominated by an existing member.  
  
The bylaws do _not_ , however, require that directors be members. Board
elections are coming up soon, and so anyone interested in becoming a director
is invited to nominate themselves, by editing this `Wiki
page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2010>`_.
There is a link on that page to an outline of the duties and responsibilities
of being a PSF director.  
  
As chairman (at least until after the elections) I would be happy to see more
competition for the places on the Board - I think a change of lineup from time
to time is a very healthy thing, and makes it more likely that new ideas and
approaches will emerge. A board seat should be more than just a line to add to
your resume - it is also an opportunity to serve the Python community and take
a broader role in the open source world.  
  
Nominations close on Friday February 5, so think about nominating yourself, or
(with their permission) somebody else you think would be active in managing
the Foundation. If you want to discuss the possibility before moving ahead
with a nomination please feel free to email me as chairman at python dot org
for more information.
