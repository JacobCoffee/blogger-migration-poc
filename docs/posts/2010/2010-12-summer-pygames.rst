Summer pyGames
==============

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/12/summer-pygames.html>`_.

Their motto is "Learning should be fun", and with Python and PyGame, it sure
is. The Summer pyGames project, organized by Elizabeth Barndollar of BAE
Systems, Travis Axtel of SPAWAR, and Zenko Klapko of the `Charleston Linux
Users Group <http://www.csclug.org/>`_, is a six-week long competition during
which high school students develop open-source educational software and games
to be used and distributed to 3000 schools in South Carolina.

According to Elizabeth Barndollar, in two years the project has grown from
seven students to include seven teams in SC, FL, NJ, VA and Canada. The Summer
pyGames is helping to inspire students, teach them the value of open-source
software, and (even better) learn Python. in the first two editions, XO
laptops and netbooks were distributed to the wining teams. This year the
organizers are planning to have even more great prizes.

Registration to the 2011 contest is on "Pi day", 03/14/2011. All students are
challenged to participate and create games that make Math, Language and
Science fun.

UPDATE: Recently, the PSF awarded a US$ 1,000 grant to help in the
organization of the upcoming edition.
