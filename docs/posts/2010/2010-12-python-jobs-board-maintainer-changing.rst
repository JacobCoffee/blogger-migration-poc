Python Jobs Board Maintainer Changing
=====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/12/python-jobs-board-maintainer-changing.html>`_.

The `Python Job Board <http://www.python.org/community/jobs/>`_ has been
maintained for over 4 years primarily by one person: Martin Thomas. Recently,
Martin has decided to pass the reins to Chris Withers. The PSF would like to
thank Martin for his hard work and wish him well on his new endeavors. We
would also like to welcome Chris to his new position an d applaud him for
taking up this new responsibility.

Don't Know About the Job Board?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some members of the community may not be aware of the Python Job Board, a free
list of open positions using Python and related tools. You'll find career
opportunities working with Django, Plone, SQLAlchemy, CSS, HTML, Database
Administration, and much more. Although the jobs are in a variety of
industries, and located all over the world, the common thread that ties them
all together is Python.
