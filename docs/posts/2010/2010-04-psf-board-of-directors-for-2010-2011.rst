The Python Software Foundation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `mission of the PSF <http://www.python.org/psf/mission/>`_:

> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
> advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
> growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

About the Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PSF Directors are elected annually and are responsible for managing the
business of the foundation, as outlined in the
`bylaws <http://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/>`_. They fulfill two
responsibilities:

  1. Completing or overseeing administrative tasks related to the legal standing of the Foundation. These include responding to trademark or licensing queries and monitoring the Foundation's financial health.
  2. Completing "special projects" such as `fund raising <http://www.python.org/psf/donations/>`_, `administering grants <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_, and supporting day-to-day operations of the Python community.

A director's specific duties depend on the office and any sub-committee
memberships held. The board meets monthly via IRC. Minutes from the meetings
are `available online <http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/>`_. Most
Directors are volunteers, although some Officer positions (Treasurer and
Secretary) do receive a nominal salary.
