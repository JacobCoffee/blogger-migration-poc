Funding for PyCon PL'10
=======================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/09/funding-for-pycon-pl10.html>`_.

The PSF Board has offered a grant of $750 to the organizers of the `PyCon
Poland 2010 <http://pl.pycon.org/2010>`_ conference.

Conference Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyCon Poland 2010 will take place from October 8 to 10, which is a little
earlier than the previous conference. The conference will be held at the
Centre for Leisure-Training "Gwarek" in Ustron Jaszowiec in Cieszyn Silesia,
the same location as last year.

The `conference website <http://pl.pycon.org/2010>`_ mentions a planned hot
grill, barbecue on Saturday 9th, and also names the possibility to burn off
those calories in the gym or sauna.

Presentation topics include programming Python and Ajax, optimization and
profiling, physics, math, administrative tasks, GPU programming, and more.

See the `conference website <http://pl.pycon.org/2010>`_ web site for more
details about the conference.
