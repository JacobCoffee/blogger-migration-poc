More PyCon 2010 Conference Grants
=================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/05/more-pycon-2010-conference-grants.html>`_.

At their May 10 meeting, the PSF Board approved grants for two PyCon
conferences.

PyCon Ukraine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`PyCamp Kyiv <http://pycamp.org.ua/>`_, held in January 2010, attracted over 200
attendees so the organizers are planning to host another event this fall.
`PyCon Ukraine 2010 <http://ua.pycon.org/>`_ is scheduled for October 23-24 in
Kyiv, Ukraine. The PSF Board approved a grant of $750US to support the new
conference.

SciPy 2010
^^^^^^^^^^

`SciPy 2010 <http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2010/>`_ will be held in Austin,
Texas from June 28 to July 3. SciPy is focused on the intersection of
scientific computing and Python development, and offers scientists and
developers an opportunity to collaborate and share tools and techniques. The
PSF Board approved a grant of $1,000US to sponsor the conference.

_Organizers for other conferences who would like to apply for a grant should
send details of their request to the board at psf @python.org._
