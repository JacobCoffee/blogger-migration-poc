The Python Job Board: Anything But Boring
=========================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/08/python-job-board-anything-but-boring.html>`_.

Some members of the community may not be aware of the `Python Job
Board <http://www.python.org/community/jobs/>`_, a free list of open positions
using Python and related tools. You'll find career opportunities working with
Django, Plone, SqlAlchemy, CSS, HTML, Database Administration, and much more.
Although the jobs are in a variety of industries, and located all over the
world, the common thread that ties them all together is Python.

Are you hiring?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Listing an open position on the job board is free. If you have a Python-
related job opening, email `jobs@python.org <mailto:jobs@python.org>`_ with your
information. Be sure to check out the current listings to get a feel for how
you should write yours and follow the provided reStructuredText template.

Volunteer Maintainers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The job board is maintained by the Python.org web team, including Martin
Thomas who took over as the primary maintainer from Peter Kropf over 4 years
ago. According to Martin, new job listings come in at a rate of anywhere
between one a week to ten per _day_!

In the near future, Martin is planning to add a Twitter feed so you can get
your job listing fix in real time. We'll have more information about that when
the feed is active.
