PyPI Security and Accessibility Q1 2019 Request for Proposals period opens.
===========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/11/pypi-security-and-accessibility-q1-2019.html>`_.

The `Python Software Foundation <https://python.org/psf-landing>`_ `Packaging
Working Group <https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#packaging-work-group>`_
has applied for and received a commitment from the `Open Technology
Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/>`_ to fulfill a contract via their `Core
Infrastructure Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/funds/core-infrastructure-
fund/>`_.  

The `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_ is a foundational
component of the `Python <https://python.org/>`_ ecosystem and broader computer
software and technology landscape. This project aims to improve the security
and accessibility of PyPI for all users worldwide, whether they are direct
users, like project maintainers and ``pip
install` <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ers, or indirect users. The impact of
this work will be highly visible and improve crucial features of the service.

We plan to begin the project in January 2019. Because of the size of the
project, funding has been allocated to secure one or more contractors to
complete the development, testing, verification, and assist in the rollout of
necessary features.

What is the Request for Proposals period?
-----------------------------------------

A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a process intended to allow us (The Python
Software Foundation) to collect proposals from potential contractors and
select contractor(s) best suited to fulfill the specified work.

After the RFP period closes we will evaluate the received proposals based on
the evaluation criteria, seek clarification from proposers as necessary, and
select one or more contractors to complete the work specified in the scope.

The Request for Proposals period opens today, November 19th, 2018, and is
scheduled to close *December 15, 2018
*`AoE <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe>`_.
