Join the 2018 Python Developers Survey: Share and learn about the community
===========================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/10/join-2018-python-developers-survey.html>`_.

2018 is drawing to a close and we are excited to start the official *Python
Developers Survey for 2018*!  
  
In 2017, Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains conducted an
official Python Developers Survey for the first time. Over 9,500 developers
from almost 150 different countries participated to help us map out an
accurate landscape of the Python community.  
  
With this second iteration of the official Python Developers Survey, we aim to
identify how the Python development world looks today and how it compares to
last year. The results of the survey will serve as a major source of knowledge
about the current state of the Python community, so we encourage you to
participate and make an invaluable contribution to this community resource.
The survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

2018! <https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/c11-python-developers-survey-2018>`_  
  
Your valuable opinion and feedback will help us better understand how
different Python developers use Python, related frameworks, tools, and
technologies. We also hope you'll have fun going through the questions.  
  
The survey is organized in partnership between the Python Software Foundation
and JetBrains. After the survey is over, we will publish the aggregated
results and randomly choose 100 winners (those who complete the survey in its
entirety), who will each receive an amazing *Python Surprise Gift Pack*.
