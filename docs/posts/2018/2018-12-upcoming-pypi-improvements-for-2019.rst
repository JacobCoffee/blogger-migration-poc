Upcoming PyPI Improvements for 2019
===================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/12/upcoming-pypi-improvements-for-2019.html>`_.

The `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/>`_ (PyPI) is far and away the
largest and most visible service that the `Python Software
Foundation <https://www.python.org/psf-landing/>`_ (PSF) supports for the Python
community. Throughout the project’s 16 year history, it has primarily relied
on volunteers and donated services to operate as it grew from an empty
repository to one hosting more than 1.1 million releases for over 162,000
projects and serving more than 2.2 petabytes in 13.8 billion requests in the
last month.

  

In November 2017, we `announced <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-
awarded-moss-grant-pypi.html>`_ an award from the `Mozilla Open Source
Support <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/>`_ (MOSS) program that made it
possible to `launch <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/03/warehouse-all-new-
pypi-is-now-in-beta.html>`_ the `ground up
rewrite <https://github.com/pypa/warehouse>`_ of PyPI’s backend in April of
2018. This milestone has offered lower maintenance overhead and helped put the
codebase into a much better state to add new features, improved security, and
increased accessibility for users.

  

While some smaller features have already been proposed, designed, submitted,
reviewed, and merged by volunteer contributors, other larger improvements
warrant paid work. As 2019 approaches, we are excited to look forward to plans
that will help deliver important improvements to the security and
accessibility of PyPI.

  

As a grant-giving non-profit, the Python Software Foundation is grateful to
the organizations that make funding this work possible. For 2019 we are glad
to have two initiatives in the works.

  

Facebook Gift
-------------

  

We’re excited to announce that `Facebook <https://research.fb.com/>`_ has
provided the Python Software Foundation with a monetary gift that will be used
to fund the development and deployment of enhanced security features to PyPI.
As a major Python user, contributor, and supporter, Facebook was impressed
with the success of the MOSS award and is enthusiastically assisting with
further enhancements to PyPI with this gift.

  

The PSF `Packaging Working
Group <https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#packaging-work-group>`_ plans to
use these funds to implement highly requested security features in PyPI such
as cryptographic signing and verification of files uploaded and installed from
the index. Additionally, systems for the automated detection of malicious
uploads will lower the time to response and improve the resiliency of PyPI
against attacks such as “`pytosquatting <https://pytosquatting.overtag.dk/>`_”.

  

This work will be undertaken in the second half of 2019 but planning will
begin in the second quarter of the year.

  

Open Technology Fund
--------------------

  

The `Open Technology Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/funds/>`_ (OTF) supports
projects and people that develop open and accessible technologies promoting
human rights and open societies and help advance inclusive and safe access to
global communications networks.

  

The PSF `Packaging Working
Group <https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#packaging-work-group>`_ is
delighted to have been awarded a contract through the `OTF Core Infrastructure
Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/funds/core-infrastructure-fund/>`_ to add key
security features to PyPI including API keys, multi-factor authentication, and
audit logs. Additionally, accessibility and localization features will be a
key focus as we ensure service’s ability to support our global community of
users.

  

Get Involved
------------

  

We plan to begin this work in the first quarter of 2019, if you’re interested
in getting involved, keep reading!

  

If you’re interested in getting involved, you can do so today by responding to
our `Request for Proposals <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/12/pypi-security-
and-accessibility-q1-2019.html>`_ to fulfill the OTF contract. This RFP will
close January 25th, 2019 `AoE <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe>`_. If
you’re interested in getting involved at a later date to complete the work
planned for the Facebook Gift, keep your eyes on this blog, `subscribe to the
PSF newsletter <https://www.python.org/psf/newsletter/>`_, or follow us on
`Twitter <https://twitter.com/thepsf>`_.
