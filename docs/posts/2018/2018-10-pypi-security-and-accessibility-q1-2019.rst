PyPI Security and Accessibility Q1 2019 Request for Information period opens.
=============================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/10/pypi-security-and-accessibility-q1-2019.html>`_.

The `Python Software Foundation <https://python.org/psf-landing>`_ `Packaging
Working Group <https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#packaging-work-group>`_
has applied for and received a commitment from the `Open Technology
Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/>`_ to fulfill a contract for their `Core
Infrastructure Fund <https://www.opentech.fund/funds/core-infrastructure-
fund/>`_.

`PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ is a foundational component of the
`Python <https://python.org/>`_ ecosystem and broader computer software and
technology landscape. This project aims to improve the security and
accessibility of PyPI for all users worldwide, whether they are direct users
like project maintainers and ``pip
install` <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ers or indirect users. The impact of
this work will be highly visible and improve crucial features of the service.

We plan to begin the project in January 2019. Because of the size of the
project, funding has been allocated to secure one or more contractors to
complete the development, testing, verification, and assist in the rollout of
necessary features.

What is the Request for Information period?
-------------------------------------------

A Request for Information (RFI) is a process intended to allow us (The Python
Software Foundation) and potential contractors to openly share information to
improve the scope and definition of the project at hand.

We hope that it will help potential contractors better understand the work to
be completed and develop better specified proposals. Additionally we hope that
the open nature of our RFI will expose the project to multiple perspectives
and potentially help shape the direction for some choices in the project.

The Request for Information period opens today, October 30, 2018, and is
scheduled to close *November 13, 2018*.

After the RFI period closes, we will use the results of the process to prepare
and open a Request for Proposals to solicit proposals from contractors to
complete the work.
