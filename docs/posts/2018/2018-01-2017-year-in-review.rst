2017: A year in review
======================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/01/2017-year-in-review.html>`_.

In 2017, Python was both the most popular and the fastest-growing programming
language. At least, we can plausibly claim that, `based on statistics recently
published on the Stack Overflow
blog <https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/>`_. As
David Robinson writes:

Python's versatility, clean syntax, and welcoming community have continued to
win people over, and now we have a new advantage: data science is a growth
industry and Python is positioned ideally. Who would have thought our 26-year-
old language would outrun Javascript, Go, and Swift? Python's rapid growth in
2017, and its bright prospects for 2018, are the community's greatest
achievement of the year.  
  
This past year the Python Software Foundation continued to give out grants and
support many events all around the world. There are too many events to list in
this post, but you can see some of the resolutions we passed in our `monthly
minutes <https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/>`_. Through our
awards program, we recognized members within our community for their work and
tireless efforts. We made changes to our bylaws to make the PSF more
sustainable. Additionally, the PSF board members met in person twice this year
to have important discussions about our future goals and direction. We created
a process for accepting new Fellow members. Lastly, Mozilla granted the PSF's
Packaging Work Group a grant to work on the future PyPI, Warehouse.  
  

Grants
------

In 2017, the PSF awarded over 220 grants (40 more than last year) amounting to
more than $257,000. Prior to 2017, most grants were reviewed by the Board of
Directors. Of the $257,000 approximately 25% of the funds went to requests
from Africa, 23% went to Europe, 19% went to Asia, 18% went to North America,
13% went to South America, and 2% went to Australia. In July of this year we
transitioned all grant requests to our Grant Work Group. This operational
improvement has freed up our Directors to have more discussion about the PSF's
direction and future goals. The PSF is grateful for the Grant Work Group
volunteers for all of the work they do reviewing requests.  
The Python community had several first time conferences in 2017. Here are a
few:  
  
*PyCon Pune*  
PyCon Pune was a successful conference. The conference held the first set of
Python development sprints in India. The conference had around 550 attendees
and a single track. Even though they are unable to host one in 2018, we hope
to see one in 2019! Check them out on
`Twitter <https://twitter.com/pyconpune?lang=en>`_!

Awards
------




Distinguished Service Award
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building on the ideals of the Foundation's Community Service Award, the
Distinguished Service Award is an offer of recognition for exemplary
contributions to the Python community. The Foundation's highest award is given
for actions which carry significant impact that shapes the Python world,
whether through contributions of code, efforts in community action, or
otherwise.  
  
We do not award the DSA often, but when we do, we give it out to invaluable,
long-time community contributors. In 2017, we voted to award the `DSA to Tim
Peters <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-distinguished-
awards/#id1>`_.  
  
Alex Martelli nominated Tim a few years back saying,  

> His technical contributions to Python have been absolutely immense: even
> just for "timsort" he'd deserve the award, and he's done SO much more than
> just that, even just on the technical plane! In addition to his enormous
> number of technical contributions (let's not forget doctest, timeit, etc,
> etc...!!!), for years, he was the friendliest, funniest, most helpful and
> technically deep contributor to the Python mailing list; his chapter intro
> in the Python Cookbook is an absolute gem; and he's ALSO striven to help
> organizationally. I think he's an outstanding candidate.  
>  It's true that most of his contributions were a while ago, but this award
> is not about "what have you done for me lately"; it's a "lifetime-
> achievement" award, and, this being the case, nobody deserves it more than
> Tim.




Community Service Awards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This year we awarded `Community Service
Awards <https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/>`_ to six
contributors. `Eric Floehr <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/eric-floehr-
community-service-award-3rd.html>`_ received an award for his involvement and
chairing of PyOhio Conference. We recognized `Thomas
Kluyver <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/10/thomas-kluyver-community-service-
award.html>`_ for his contributions to the Scientific Python Community.  `Lynn
Roo <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/09/the-pylady-behind-pyladies-lynn-
root.html>`_t also received a community service award for her work as the
founder of the San Francisco Chapter of PyLadies, as a member of the Django
Software Foundation, and as a tireless volunteer at PyCon. `Glyph
Lefkowitz <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/08/the-ethical-maintainer-
community.html>`_ was recognized for his work on the Twisted network programming
framework. `Brian Costlow <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/04/brian-costlow-
quietly-amazing-rock.html>`_ received an award for his work organizing and
chairing PyOhio, and for being the head volunteer for PyCon US captioning.
`Ian Cordasco <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-ego-less-developer-
community.html>`_ received a community service award for being the PSF elections
administrator and for mentoring women in the Python community.  We will
announce two more awards for Q4 at the end of January.  




Frank Willison Memorial Award
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every year the Python Software Foundation awards the Frank Willison Memorial
Award to a member(s) of the Python community. The purpose of this award is to
recognize the outstanding contributions that Python community members have
made having began as an award, ‚Äúestablished in memory of Frank Willison, a
Python enthusiast and O'Reilly editor-in-chief, who died in July 2001‚Äù.

  

The Python Software Foundation award the 2017 Frank Willison Award to Katie
Cunningham and Barbara Shaurette in recognition of their continuing work to
create and run their Young Coders classes, along with freely distributing
their teaching materials. `Read more about their
story <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/05/2017-frank-willson-memorial-award-

Bylaw changes
-------------

During our yearly elections, we made several changes to our bylaws in 2017. We
eased the requirement for members needing to certify yearly if they wanted to
vote on Foundation matters. Additionally, we instituted a bylaw that would
allow a work group to approve new PSF Fellow members. We created staggered
board terms so our work is more sustainable and so we have more continuity. We
established two Direct Officer positions in an effort to become a more stable
and mature board. Lastly, we also updated the way compensation is regulated so
the entire board has control of it instead of the President. To read more
details about the changes, `please check out our post from July
2017 <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/07/2017-bylaw-changes.html>`_.




Launch of PSF Fellow Work Group
-------------------------------

We are happy to report that we now have a way to accept new PSF Fellow
Members. With the opening of membership back in 2014, we overlooked a way to
accept new Fellow level members so that has been on hold until now. We've
announced two rounds of Fellow Members since we launched:

  

`2017 Q3 PSF Fellows <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/10/python-software-
foundation-fellow.html>`_  
`2017 Q4 PSF Fellows <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/12/python-software-
foundation-fellow.html>`_

If you are interested in nominating someone, `check out the info
page <https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/>`_.




MOSS Grant to deploy Warehouse
------------------------------

Python programmers wondered for all of 2017, "When will the new PyPI be done?"
In November we announced a breakthrough: Mozilla granted $170,000 to complete
PyPI's rewrite and make it the official package index.  
  
We finished the year strong by starting work on Warehouse (the improved PyPI)
via the grant awarded by Mozilla, through the Foundational Technology track of
their Open Source Support Program. The PSF's Packaging Work Group is in full
swing for the next six months working on various bug fixes, improvements, and
implementations. If you are interested in more details, please `see the grant
announcement <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-awarded-moss-grant-
pypi.html>`_.
