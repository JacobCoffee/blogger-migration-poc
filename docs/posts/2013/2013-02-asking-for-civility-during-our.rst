Asking for civility during our trademark dispute
================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/02/asking-for-civility-during-our.html>`_.

When we first announced `our trademark
issues <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/02/python-trademark-at-risk-in-
europe-we.html>`_ yesterday, we immediately and continually received a great
outpouring of support from our community. The number of supporting emails in
our inbox is tremendous, and the financial support has been incredible. For
this, we thank all of you.  
  
However, it has come to our attention that the organization with which we are
currently involved in a trademark dispute has been receiving messages from our
community members, including threats. We ask that no matter who you support in
this matter, that you remain civil in your communications and actions.  
  
It is important that we maintain the positive and friendly atmosphere that
Python is known for regardless of the situation at hand.
