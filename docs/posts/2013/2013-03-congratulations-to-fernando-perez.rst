*On Saturday March 23, Dr. Fernando Perez was presented the` Free Software
Foundation’s <http://www.fsf.org/>`_ annual Award for the Advancement of Free
Software for his work on `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_. The award “is given
annually to an individual who has made a great contribution to the progress
and development of free software, through activities that accord with the
spirit of free software.”*

Fernando, who was elected to the PSF in 2010, received the award at
LibrePlanet 2013, which took place at Harvard University in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. He dedicated the award to the late John Hunter, creator of
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_, who passed away last August. John was
posthumously awarded the Foundation’s `Distinguished Service
Award <http://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-distinguished-awards/>`_.

  

The Foundation congratulates Fernando on his great work on IPython and his
efforts all around the community!
