Cloud, HPC And Open Technologies Converge To Fuel Research, Innovation
======================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/09/cloud-hpc-and-open-technologies.html>`_.

When you put leaders of industry, research, and academia in a room for a day,
what do you get? If you were at `Argonne National
Laboratory <http://www.anl.gov/>`_ last month for the workshop on resource
intensive open clouds, you got a taste of progress. The workshop was organized
by leaders from `Notre Dame University <http://crc.nd.edu/>`_,
`Internet2 <http://www.internet2.edu/>`_, and
`Rackspace <http://www.rackspace.com/>`_, in the interests of figuring out the
next steps for the technical computing world, bridging old-world high
performance computing with the new-world of cloud computing.  
  
I was invited to this workshop on behalf of the PSF, and was excited by the
prospect of being involved in an open and collaborative environment, tasked
with figuring out how all of these sides of the story could come together.
Many of the attendees are using `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org/>`_, an
open cloud computing platform implemented in Python, and Python was a key
technology for many of them in other ways. It looks like OpenStack-based and
community-owned open clouds will likely become key points as the group
progresses towards a better landscape to solve their computing needs, and if
the past is any indication, Python will remain an important piece of the
software powering it.  
  
"The pace of innovation is accelerated and the diversity of solutions and
approaches ensures that good solutions persist and not so good ones are
quickly identified," said event organizer Paul Rad of Rackspace, on the topic
of open and transparent workshops like this one.  
  
My hope for this group is that future workshops can leverage some of our
leaders in Python's large scientific community, many of whom are undoubtedly
facing the challenges this workshop set out to improve on. Feel free to
contact me at `brian@python.org <mailto:brian@python.org>`_ if you're interested
in contributing to future efforts.

initiative and/or in participating in future workshop sessions, please email
