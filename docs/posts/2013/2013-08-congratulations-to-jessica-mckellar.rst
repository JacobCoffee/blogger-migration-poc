=========================================================================

The Python Software Foundation congratulates Jessica McKellar for winning a
`2013 O'Reilly Open Source
Award <http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/29956>`_ for her
contributions to the Python community. The award was presented at OSCON in
Portland, Oregon on July 26.

`Jessica <http://jesstess.com/>`_ is an entrepreneur, software engineer, and
open source developer from Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. She is also a
prolific volunteer in the Python community:  
  
She is currently a `Director <http://www.python.org/psf/members/#board-of-
directors>`_ for the Foundation and vice-chair of the PSF's `Outreach and
Education Committee <http://psf-outreach.org/>`_. She is also an organizer for
the `largest Python user group in the world <http://bostonpython.com/>`_ in
Boston, Massachusetts, USA. With that group she runs the `Boston Python
Workshop <http://bostonpythonworkshop.com/>`_, an introductory programming
pipeline that has brought hundreds of women into the local Python community.
The group has been so successful that it is being replicated in cities across
the US.  
  
She is tirelessly constructing new curricula and events that she play-tests
with Boston Python and then pushes to the broader community under a permissive
license to re-use and remix. Examples include an `intro to Python workshop for
first-time programmers <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/11/boston-python-
workshop-psf-grant.html>`_, an `intro to open source contribution
workshop <https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/4/>`_, a project-based
`intermediate Python workshop <https://openhatch.org/blog/2012/intermediate-
python-workshop-wrap-up/>`_, and a `CPython sprint for new
contributors <http://pythonsprints.com/2013/05/5/bostons-cpython-sprint-new-
contributors/>`_.  
  
In addition to being a frequent conference speaker herself, Jessica has been
evangelizing Python and PyCon in her role as the `Diversity
Outreach <http://us.pycon.org/2014/about/staff/>`_ coordinator for PyCon 2014.  
  

Thank you Jessica for all your contributions to the Python community.
