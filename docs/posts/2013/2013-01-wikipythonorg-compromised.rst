wiki.python.org Compromised
===========================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/01/wikipythonorg-compromised.html>`_.

On December 28th, an unknown attacker used a previously unknown remote code
exploit on <http://wiki.python.org/>. The attacker was able to get shell
access as the "moin" user, but no other services were affected.  
  
Some time later, the attacker deleted all files owned by the "moin" user,
including all instance data for both the Python and Jython wikis. The attack
also had full access to all `MoinMoin <http://moinmo.in/>`_ user data on all
wikis. In light of this, the Python Software Foundation encourages all wiki
users to change their password on other sites if the same one is in use
elsewhere. We apologize for the inconvenience and will post further news as we
bring the new and improved `wiki.python.org <http://wiki.python.org/>`_ online.  
  
If you have any questions about this incident please contact
`jnoller@python.org <mailto:jnoller@python.org>`_. Thank you for your patience.
