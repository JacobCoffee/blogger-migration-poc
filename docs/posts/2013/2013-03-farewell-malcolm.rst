Farewell Malcolm
================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/03/farewell-malcolm.html>`_.

While we celebrated the Python community last week at PyCon, we quietly lost
one of our own. Malcolm Tredinnick, core Django developer and longtime member
of the PSF passed away this past weekend.  
  
Malcolm embodied the type of ideals that we all strive for in the Python
community. He was known both for his code and for his kindness, for his
intelligence and his humanity. Malcolm was a regular in the #django channel on
IRC. It might have been intimidating to new users to be chatting with the
author of the Django ORM, but he always took the time to put people at ease
and answer their questions.  
  
We are grateful to have known Malcolm. We will miss him.  
  
As Barbara Shaurette `wrote <http://mechanicalgirl.com/post/farewell-
malcolm/>`_:  
  
"""  
I encourage everyone to honor Malcolm's memory by following his example.  
  
Submit that patch for a Django ORM ticket that you've putting off for a while.  
  
Go into #django and help some new users.  
  
Answer questions. Be nice.
