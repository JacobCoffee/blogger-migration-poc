PSF Python Brochure now available! Get your copy in Montreal!
=============================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/04/psf-python-brochure-now-available-get.html>`_.

After three long years, the PSF Python Brochure is finally printed. The first
batch was shipped to PyCon 2014 in Montreal. We would like to thank all our
initial sponsors and contributors for the hard work and the impressing result.

  

Promote Python to non-developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

Please help spread the word about how great Python is and how useful it can be
to learn Python by taking the brochure to your friends, teachers, professors,
managers and team leaders.

We believe it provides some very convincing arguments and hope that it can
serve as useful tool in furthering the PSF's mission to grow Python and its
community by reaching out to the non-developer world.

  

Get your brochure copy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

Come and *grab your copy at the Python Software Foundation table* (table #5,
