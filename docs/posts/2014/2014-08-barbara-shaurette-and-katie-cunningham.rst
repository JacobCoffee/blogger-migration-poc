Barbara Shaurette and Katie Cunningham earn Community Service Awards
====================================================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/08/barbara-shaurette-and-katie-cunningham.html>`_.

On Friday, July 18th the board of the Python Software Foundation voted to
award both Barbara Shaurette and Katie Cunningham a Community Service Award
for Q2 2014.  
  
The award is given in recognition of their work to create and run their Young
Coders classes, along with freely distributing their teaching materials.  
  
The program began at `PyCon
2013 <https://us.pycon.org/2013/events/letslearnpython/>`_ and was an immediate
success. The `followup blog post <http://pycon.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-kids-
stole-show-young-coders.html>`_ is the second most popular post in PyCon's
history by a wide margin, and the event was one of the most talked about
topics of the conference.  
  

> _“I don't think you'd ever see that kind of experimentation in a classroom
> full of adults, who would more likely do everything in their power not to
> break their computers,” Barbara wrote of the kids’ ability to learn, write,
> and run code._

Since it's beginnings in Santa Clara it has been run at several other
conferences, including again at PyCon 2014 - complete with one day having been
taught in French, PyTennessee, and most recently at PyOhio.  
  
We thank Katie and Barbara for their work in actively promoting and teaching
Python to a new generation of programmers.
