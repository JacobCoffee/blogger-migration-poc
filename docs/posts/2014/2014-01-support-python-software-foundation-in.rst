Support the Python Software Foundation in 2014
==============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/01/support-python-software-foundation-in.html>`_.

Happy New Year from the Python Software Foundation! 2013 was a busy year for
our global community, in almost `200 user
groups <https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups>`_, dozens of `regional
conferences <http://www.pycon.org/>`_, and countless open source projects,
sprints, online fora, and outreach events.  
  
Please help us continue to invest in and support the community in 2014 with a
donation. There are 2 main ways to help:  

  1. `Donate as an individual <http://python.org/psf/donations/>`_
  2. `Donate as an organization <http://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/>`_

The `Python Software Foundation <http://www.python.org/psf/>`_ is a 501(c)(3)
non-profit. For US taxpayers, contributions to the PSF are tax-deductible.
Your employer may also match your donations!  
  
*What will your money support?*

Group debugging at a PSF-sponsored Boston Python workshop  
The PSF sponsors conferences and community events across the globe, including
in 2013 alone: SciPy, PyCon Canada, PyOhio, PyCon Ireland, PyData Boston,
PythonBrasil, Kiwi PyCon, PyCon Argentina, PyConDE, RuPy, PyConUK, PyDay
Ecuador, PyConZA, and the first ever PyTennessee...whew!  
  
We provide fiscal sponsorship, cover hosting costs, and sponsor workshop for
user groups. We invest in the next generation of Python programmers by
supporting events like `Teen Tech
Camp <http://juliaelman.com/blog/2013/07/31/durham-teen-tech-camp-press-
release/>`_ and `Raspberry Pi programming in
classrooms <http://www.toranbillups.com/blog/archive/2013/06/30/Teaching-
python-to-fifth-graders/>`_.  
  
With support from the PSF's Outreach and Education program, `Ada
Camp <http://sf.adacamp.org/>`_ came to San Francisco, scientists learned
`Software Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org/>`_, `librarians learned
Python <http://litablog.org/2013/07/introduction-to-python-at-ala-annual-or-
awesome-true-ala2013py/>`_ at the ALA Annual Conference, and introductory
workshops were run by user groups around the world.  
  
The PSF `Grants program <http://www.python.org/psf/grants/>`_ enables
experimental development on projects like PyPy, and the `Sprints
program <http://pythonsprints.com/>`_ supports development on your favorite open
source Python projects. We enforce Python's trademarks, protect Python's
intellectual property, keep PyPI running, and are bringing you the `next
version of python.org <http://preview.python.org/>`_.  
  
Help us do all this and more in 2014 and `donate
today <http://python.org/psf/donations/>`_.
