==============================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/07/psf-sponsors-10th-python-brasil.html>`_.

The Python Software Foundation donated $4,552 USD to `Python Brasil
2014 <http://2014.pythonbrasil.org.br/>`_. This amount corresponds to their Gold
Level sponsorship. The conference will take place in Recife and Porto de
Galinhas, Pernambuco. They will have tutorial days November 4-5 with the main
conference taking place November 6-7. On November 8th, they will host a sprint
day. The event is being organized by the `Pernambuco Python User
Group <https://twitter.com/pugpe>`_ (PUG-PE) with the help of Apyb( PythonBrazil
Association)  
  
The organizer's behind the event had the following to say:  

> Python Brasil is one of the main events about technology at Brazil and Latin
> America related to open-source software and specially about the programming
> language Python and its derived applications. This is special year for us,
> since it is the 10th edition, a milestone in the set of events of this
> magnitude and celebrates your first release at the Northeast region of
> Brazil, which it reflects the popularity of the language spreading over all
> Brazil. The previous editions were all hosted at Southeast and south of
> Brazil.

> The event will host several success cases of organizations using Python at
> their activities and business, even more, it attracts to Brazil a
> heterogeneous audience from all over Brazil and foreign countries. More than
> 300 participants are expected to participate at this meeting, which it will
> be distributed in several activities such as the conference, desconference
> also known as Open Spaces, Job Fair, Sprints, lighting talks, tutorials,
> keynotes and exposition.

> The PythonBrasil is a traditional event that happens once a year. In the
> last editions several cities already hosted the event such as Brasilia
> (2013), Rio de Janeiro (2012), SÃ£o Paulo (2011), Curitiba (2010), Caixas do
> Sul (2009), Rio de Janeiro (2008), Joinville (2007), Brasilia (2006) and
> Campinas (2005). Through the organizations that supported the event we
> already had several federal universities, companies and recently the
> commitment of the Government and the federal parliament at Brasilia.  
>  
>  The last edition was one of the largest joining more than 400 Python
> developers and open-source enthusiasts for all over Brazil. It was a special
> edition since the event was co-hosted with the International Plone
> Conference.

> We believe this year it will be special, first it will be held at Porto de
> Galinhas, Pernambuco, an amazing beach located 37 mi south of the city of
> Recife, Pernambuco. With great environment for joining our old friends and
> even making some new ones even doing lots of network. In our opinion, the
> best part of the event will be between the talks and keynotes with the
> discussion happening at the open-spaces and our lounges covered by coffee
> (yeah Brazilian developers loves coffee). We host several events post-
> conferences. For instance, our Django Day, that it will be our second one,
> that usually happens at one bar with beer, appetizers and lighting talks. We
> are planning many other joint events, like the first Brazilian meeting of
> the PyLadies Brazil, that started this year at Natal, Rio Grande do Norte.

> With great technical talks, many invited python references coming to our
> event and lots of opportunities to meet and learn with many other
> developers, we believe this year will be quite exciting, specially an event
> in one of our main touristic points at Brazil.

  
November is a wonderful time of year to head South and visit Latin America.
Traveling internationally can take time to plan, so now is a great time to
start!
