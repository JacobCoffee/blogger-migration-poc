Python in Google Summer of Code 2014
====================================

*This was originally posted on blogger* `here <https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2014/02/python-in-google-summer-of-code-2014.html>`_.

Python project contributors and student enthusiasts, mark your calendars:
Google Summer of Code applications open soon!  
  
`Google Summer of Code <https://www.google-
melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014>`_ is an annual, global program
pairing student developers with mentors in open source projects for paid
summer internships.

`here <https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014>`_.  

Python projects
===============

Python serves as an umbrella organization for around a dozen open source
Python projects each year. This year, the following projects are
participating:  
  

  * `CPython <http://python.org/>`_: core Python and the standard library
  * `GNU Mailman <http://list.org/>`_: the ubiquitous mailing list package
  * `Mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_: a distributed source control management tool 
  * `BinPy <http://binpy.github.io/>`_: a platform for building circuit-based applications or logical games
  * `Vispy <http://vispy.org/>`_: high-performance interactive visualizations
  * `TARDIS-SN <http://tardis.readthedocs.org/>`_: supernova radiative transfer in Python
  * `SunPy <http://www.sunpy.org/>`_: Python for solar physics
  * `Scrapy <http://scrapy.org/>`_: a fast, high-level screen scraping and web crawling framework
  * `Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano>`_: an optimizing compiler for numpy.ndarray and scipy.sparse matrix
  * `Kivy <http://kivy.org/>`_: a library for making cross-platform, multi-touch apps
  * `MNE-Python <http://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html>`_: a software package for processing MEG and EEG data
  * `scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`_: a collection of algorithms for image processing
  * `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_: a Python module for machine learning
  * `PyDy <http://pydy.org/>`_: a package for studying multibody dynamics with Python
  * `SciPy and NumPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_: open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering
  * `AstroPy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_: a community Python library for astronomy

Students
========

Google Summer of Code is a paid summer internship program for
college/university students who will be 18 years of age or older on April 21,
2014. Participating in Google Summer of Code is a great way to develop real-
world software engineering skills while giving back to an open source Python
project you love.  
  
Read more about eligibility in the `FAQ <https://www.google-
melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page>`_.  
  
If you are interested in participating in Google Summer of Code under the
Python umbrella, it's time to start exploring potential projects and
practicing the tools of open source development:  

  1. Read the `Python Google Summer of Code guidelines <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2014>`_.
  2. `Review this year's projects and their idea pages <https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2014#project_ideas>`_.
  3. Start practicing the tools of open source development, including:  

     * IRC
     * a revision control system like git or svn
     * the diff and patch utilities
     * bug trackers

If you've never used some of these tools before, don't worry! You have plenty
of time to practice. A good resource for getting familiar with these tools is
the `OpenHatch training missions <http://openhatch.org/missions/>`_.  
  

Important deadlines
-------------------

  * *March 10* : Student application period opens.
  * *March 21* : Student application deadline.
  * *April 21* : Accepted student proposals announced.

Note that the best way to boost your chances of being accepted for Google
Summer of Code is to start contributing to a project *before*  you apply. If
you have questions about how to get started or just want some friendly
encouragement, visit the OpenHatch project and `say
hello <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Contact>`_.
