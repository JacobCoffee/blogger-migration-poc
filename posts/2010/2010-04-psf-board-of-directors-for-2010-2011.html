agreements</a> from all
contributors to Python core or the standard library. Raymond is Director of
Technology at SauceLabs and is a Certified Public Accountant.</p>
<p><em>Steve Holden</em> joined the PSF in 2003, its Board of Directors in 2004, and

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/mission/">mission of the PSF</a>:</p>
<p>&gt; The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
&gt; advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the

<section id="about-the-board">
<h2>About the Board<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-board" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>PSF Directors are elected annually and are responsible for managing the
business of the foundation, as outlined in the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/bylaws/">bylaws</a>. They fulfill two
responsibilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Completing or overseeing administrative tasks related to the legal standing of the Foundation. These include responding to trademark or licensing queries and monitoring the Foundation’s financial health.</p></li>
<li><p>Completing “special projects” such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/donations/">fund raising</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/grants/">administering grants</a>, and supporting day-to-day operations of the Python community.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A director’s specific duties depend on the office and any sub-committee
memberships held. The board meets monthly via IRC. Minutes from the meetings
are <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/">available online</a>. Most
Directors are volunteers, although some Officer positions (Treasurer and
Secretary) do receive a nominal salary.</p>
