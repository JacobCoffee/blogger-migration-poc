<h1>Chairman’s Report for the Year 2009<a class="headerlink" href="#chairman-s-report-for-the-year-2009" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2010/04/chairmans-report-for-year-2009_07.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>As there is desire for more communication from the board I thought I would
take the time to summarize the major activities of last year.</p>
<p>This dated list is not complete, and reflects only the formal published <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/">board

<p>Review</p>
<p>Although the above apparently represents just twelve hours of board meetings,
of necessity many of the actions detailed have required a lot of time in
preparatory work such as discussions and negotiations. I am grateful to my
fellow directors and the other officers for the work they have put in to try
and develop the Foundation.</p>
<p>Besides this formal stuff I personally have continued outreach work to such
user groups as I have been able to attend, and I would encourage other
directors to do the same. At every meeting I have found a groundswell of
interest in and support for the Foundation’s activities that is both
gratifying and humbling.</p>
<p>I have also undertaken preparatory investigations to allow us to undertake
“fiscal sponsorship”, a scheme that will effectively let user groups and other
affiliated organizations make use of the Foundation’s charitable status by
raising funds in a way that allows donors a tax deduction without the need for
formal incorporation as a 501(c)3 or similar. I hope that this will also allow
the Foundation to start sponsoring sprint activities that will get developers
together at crucial times to ensure that development velocity can be
maintained.</p>
<p>We have produced the first issue of a quarterly newsletter (small quantities
were available at PyCon) which will be the primary communications channel with
the new associate members I hope we will shortly see swelling our ranks (and
our coffers). Without the preparatory work to bring the membership management
system on-line this development would not have been practical.</p>
<p>While the Foundation is not yet as organized as I would like to see it we have
made some kind of start in a new direction. The financial problems of 2009 did
not make things easy. Much remains to be done, but overall we are much better
placed to move forward than we were a year ago.</p>
