<p><em>A quick look back at PyCon 2016</em></p>
<p>I am writing this during my flight home to Chicago as I reminisce about PyCon,
which officially ended yesterday in Portland, Oregon. This was yet another
successful conference! We had over 3200 pythonistas check in! The 2016
tutorials and talks sold out in March, which is much sooner than previous
conferences. Both committees did a great job reviewing and providing guidance
to those that needed it. Personally I only found time to watch Lars’ talk, but
thanks to our efficient AV crew, I will watch the rest in the comfort of my
home over the next few weeks. Hearing the positive feedback from our sponsors,
even when logistical issues popped up, tells me the companies that helped make
PyCon happen, are just as dedicated to our community as we are. I appreciate
their support and understanding.</p>
<p>PyCon 2016 was my ninth PyCon. I have enjoyed organizing each one of those
nine conferences. Over the last nine years I have seen the Python community
grow and become a respected community. PyCon is, for many, the central time of
the year and I know it is for me and the PSF. Through our learning experiences
at PyCon, we are able to help the Python community all around the world. We
are able to offer others insight on conference childcare, our financial aid
system, and volunteer involvement amongst other things. We also learn from
others within our community and welcome guidance for how processes could be
more effective and less overwhelming. On a larger scale, PyCon’s revenue helps
us (the PSF) fund hundreds of other PyCons and teaching workshops around the
world per year. But those are not the only ways that PyCon impacts our
community.</p>
<p><em>My main take away</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I have noticed that it is easier for us to improve and grow as a community
when we meet in person from time to time. Over the years I have learned
through my own experiences that emailing about community relations is not
always easy nor productive. When I come to PyCon and see the many
interactions, I understand the reasons why conferences are so vital to any
community. When we are face to face, we are able to put our differences and
opinions aside. It is easier for us to put ourselves into someone else’s
shoes. When we find common ground, we become a stronger community. Watching
Twitter the last few days has been my evidence for this happening at PyCon. I
have seen so many moving “good-byes” and appreciations for our community. I
have seen attendees publicly thanking our community for its openness and
acceptance. Witnessing this energizes me and inspires me to further support
the community through my PSF and PyCon work. Thank you PyCon 2016 for
motivating me and making me a stronger individual in so many ways. _Let us
keep this inspirational motivation going all year round!_</p>
<p><em>My long list of thank yous</em></p>
