<h1>“Kurt Doesn’t Drop The Ball”: Thanks For Kurt Kaiser’s 10 Years As PSF Treasurer<a class="headerlink" href="#kurt-doesn-t-drop-the-ball-thanks-for-kurt-kaiser-s-10-years-as-psf-treasurer" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2016/12/kurt-doesnt-drop-ball-thanks-for-kurt.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>“We were all amateurs,” recalls Guido van Rossum. In the early years of the
Python Software Foundation, its founders were more interested in writing code
than running a nonprofit. Guido says they only loosely tracked who had access
to the bank account and who was responsible for filing paperwork on time.
There were some close calls, and the foundation nearly missed some deadlines.
That changed when Kurt Kaiser became treasurer, ten years ago. “Kurt
straightened all that out.”</p>
<p>When Kaiser took over the job, the PSF was a small foundation giving out a few
thousand dollars a year in grants. The accounting was handed over to him
without much explanation or support; he learned the system and grew it to what
it is today. The PSF now awards <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/grants/">dozens of grants a
year</a> totalling over a quarter million
dollars. The foundation accepts money from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/sponsors/">PSF
sponsors</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/sponsors/">PyCon
sponsors</a>, members, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/psf/donations/">donors</a>; it provides financial aid
to hundreds of conference attendees, <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.ca/2012/03/user-groups-psf-can-help-cover-your.html">covers Meetup.com
fees</a>, and acts as a fiscal sponsor to groups like PyLadies, lending its
nonprofit status to these smaller organizations. Kaiser manages all these
transactions. When processes become routine, he automates them with code.
Board member Diana Clarke says, “He’s more than just your typical treasurer;
he’s a developer plus treasurer.”</p>
<p>Kurt Kaiser was a physicist throughout his career, and picked up Python as a
hobby. His first great contribution was the code he wrote for IDLE, the
development GUI that comes bundled with Python. At first he was a user and
contributor to the project, but that changed in the wake of conflicts among
its maintainers. “After the combatants of the IDLE war withdrew,” says Guido,
“Kurt became a lead developer. He had a much smoother personality.” When the
PSF needed a new treasurer, Kaiser was entrusted with the role. “He just got
so into the cause,” says Director of Operations Ewa Jodlowska. “He believed he
was helping the greater good by helping the PSF.”</p>
<p>This year alone, through the end of October, the PSF has awarded $260,000 to
more than 50 entities. Kaiser administers this swelling <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/">stream of
grants</a>. The work is
not all routine: a recent grant to PyCon CZ, for example, required special
handling, because Czech bank account IDs have a different format than American
accounts. Some grants pose extraordinary hurdles, like the PSF’s support for a
PyCon in Zimbabwe. Kaiser researched the United States’ financial embargo of
Zimbabwe, and the PSF concluded it could not sponsor the conference, but it
could still lend support by sending a keynote speaker.</p>
<p>Each year, a new Board of Directors brings new ideas for funding Python
advocacy, but these ideas can raise knotty questions about financial rules.
According to Diana Clarke, it is tempting to balk at these complexities and
simply say no, but Kaiser is always willing to research new options that meet
the community’s changing needs.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/psf/mission/">The PSF’s mission</a> is to advance the
Python language, and increasingly it uses Python as a vehicle for promoting
access to computer science for women, minorities, and members of underserved
groups. For example, the PSF collects money on behalf of PyLadies, which
allows them to operate under the PSF’s nonprofit umbrella without going
through all the paperwork. Clarke says, “The PyLadies auction raises money and
then turns that around in the form of scholarships, and Kurt is the one who
enables that. It’s a nontrivial amount of work and it’s very important.”</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2017/financial-assistance/">The PyCon Financial Aid program</a> is another way the PSF spends money to promote access to computer
science. Guido van Rossum says, “What better use of that money, than to pay
for people to come to the conference who couldn’t otherwise come, people who
are a good investment for the community?” The PSF awards $100,000 in
scholarships to help people come to PyCon from all over the world. Kaiser
administers these scholarships one-on-one: he disburses money, collects
receipts, and receives conference write-ups from recipients.</p>
<p>When Diana Clarke worked with Kaiser at PyCon, she was struck at his singular
role in the conference. He has to carry a briefcase of cash, and he manually
writes hundreds of checks to ensure attendees receive their awards. Instead of
being free to attend talks, Kaiser often sits in the hallway to be available
when scholarship recipients need to pick up their money.</p>
<p>Kurt Kaiser is among the PSF’s longest-serving officers. As Diana Clarke says,
“He does so much for us, and most people don’t have a lot of insight into what
he does.” On his tenth anniversary as treasurer, the PSF congratulates him and
thanks him. From its early years as a small foundation through today, Kaiser
has been a consistent and reliable steward of the organization’s finances.
“For a long time Kurt was the only stable point,” says Guido. “We know that
Kurt doesn’t drop the ball.”</p>
