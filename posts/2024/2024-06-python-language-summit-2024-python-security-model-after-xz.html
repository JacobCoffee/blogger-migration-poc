Pablo Galindo Salgado describing the xz-utils backdoor
(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)</p>
<p>The backdoor of the popular compression project xz-utils was
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">discovered</a> on
Friday, March 29th 2024, by Andres Freund. Andres is an engineer at Microsoft
who noticed performance issues with SSH while contributing to the Postgres
project. Andres wasn’t looking for security issues, but after digging into the
problem further had discovered an attempt to subvert SSH logins across
multiple Linux distros.</p>
<p>This was a social engineering attack to gain elevated access to a project,
also known as an “insider threat”. An account named “Jia Tan” had begun
contributing to the xz-utils project soon after the original maintainer had
announced on the mailing list that they were struggling with maintenance of
the project. Through the use of multiple sock-puppet accounts pressuring the
maintainer and over a year of high-quality contributions, eventually Jia Tan
was made a release manager for the project.</p>
<p>&gt; “Jia Tan may have a bigger role in the project in the future. He has been
&gt; helping a lot off-list and is practically a co-maintainer already. :-)”
&gt;
&gt; — xz-utils maintainer, Lasse Collin
&gt;</p>
<p>Over time a series of small subversive changes were made to the project all
culminating in a tainted release artifact that put the backdoor in motion.
Luckily for all of us, Andres discovered the attack before the new version was
deployed more widely.</p>
<section id="how-is-python-similar-to-xz-utils">
<h2>How is Python similar to xz-utils?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-is-python-similar-to-xz-utils" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pablo Galindo Salgado, Steering Council member and the release manager for
Python 3.10 and 3.11, brought this topic to the Language Summit to discuss
what could be done to improve Python’s security model in the wake of the xz-
utils backdoor.</p>
<p>Pablo noted the similarities shared between CPython and xz-utils, referencing
the previous Language Summit’s talk on <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-summit-2023-burnout.html">core developer
burnout</a>, the number of modules in the standard library that
have one or zero maintainers, the high ratio of maintainers to source code,
and the use of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Autotools">autotools</a> for
configuration. Autotools was used by Jia Tan as part of the backdoor,
specifically to obscure the changes to tainted release artifacts.</p>
<p>Pablo confirmed along with many nods of agreement that indeed, CPython could
be vulnerable to a contributor or core developer getting secretly malicious
changes merged into the project.</p>

“Could this happen in CPython? Yes!” – Pablo</p>
<p>For multiple reasons like being able to fix bugs and single-maintainer
modules, CPython doesn’t require reviewers on the pull requests of core
developers. This can lead to “unilateral action”, meaning that a change is
introduced into CPython without the review of someone besides the author.
Other situations like release managers backporting fixes to other branches
without review are common.</p>
<p>There was also an emphasis on “binary files”, like wheels, images,
certificates, and test data that is checked into the CPython repository. Today
some of this data doesn’t have a known “upstream” or source where it was
generated from making introspection difficult. Part of the xz-utils backdoor
utilized binary test data in order to smuggle code into the release artifacts
without being reviewed by other developers.</p>
</section>
<section id="so-what-can-be-done">
<h2>So what can be done?<a class="headerlink" href="#so-what-can-be-done" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There aren’t any silver bullets when it comes to social engineering and
insider threats. Barry Warsaw and Carol Willing both emphasized the importance
having an action plan in advance for what to do if something similar to the
xz-utils backdoor were to happen in order to promptly fix the issue and alert
the community.</p>
<p>Thomas Wouters asked the group whether the xz-utils backdoor was a serious
enough event to force a new workflow to be adopted by core developers. Thomas
noted that mandatory review of all pull requests had been <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/sc-poll-should-we-require-reviews-to-merge-all-prs/29410">discussed
previously</a> and wasn’t adopted at the time, but also wasn’t discussed
as a security issue like it is today. There’s been a hesitance to break
peoples’ workflows or make it impossible to get bugs fixed. This change would
also require a cultural change to make asking for code reviews more common
amongst core developers to be effective.</p>
<p>Carol Willing concurred, noting that almost every other project she’s
contributing to requires reviews for all pull requests.</p>
<p>Guido van Rossum was less convinced that having additional review would help
much for security. Guido was more concerned about who is given “commit bit”
(write access) in the first place, asking for a higher bar such as whether
someone had met the person in real life, at a conference, or over a video
call.</p>
<p>Mariatta agreed with verifying identities of core developers, including
requiring updates to reconfirm the identities of individuals noting that this
is commonplace for employment. Mariatta noted that the contributions being
done by CPython core developers is of equal or more importance than any
individuals’ employment.</p>
<p>Some doubt was thrown on verifying identities, especially via video call, as
it’s now not unheard of for someone being interviewed for employment over a
video call to be different from the person who shows up on the first day of
work.</p>
<p>Hugo van Kemenade remarked on removing inactive core developers, noting that
it’s already documented in the <a class="reference external" href="https://devguide.python.org">CPython developer
guide</a> that inactive or unreachable core
developers can be removed with or without notice. There was agreement within
the group that this should be done more actively to reduce the chances that
unattended privileged accounts are resurrected by malicious actors.</p>
<p>There was some discussion about removing modules from the standard library,
especially modules which are not used or have no maintainers. Toshio Kuratomi
cautioned that moving modules out of the standard library only pushes the
problem outwards to one or more projects on PyPI. Łukasz Langa concurred on
this point referencing specifically the
“<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/chunk.html">chunk</a>” module removed via
<a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/#chunk">PEP 594</a> and feeling unsure whether
the alternative project on PyPI should be recommended to users given the
author not being reachable.</p>
<p>Overall it was clear there is more discussion and work to be done in this
rapidly changing area.</p>
