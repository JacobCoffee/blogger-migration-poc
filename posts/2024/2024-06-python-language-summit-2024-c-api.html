<h1>The Python Language Summit 2024: Native Interface and Limited C API<a class="headerlink" href="#the-python-language-summit-2024-native-interface-and-limited-c-api" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-c-api.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Back in October 2023, <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0731/">PEP 731</a> proposed a
new <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/capi-workgroup">C API working group</a>
<a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0731/#motivation">charged</a> with overseeing and
coordinating the development and maintenance of the Python C API. This working
group spawned from a <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-python-language-summit-2023-three.html">series of discussions on the C
API</a> from the Language Summit in 2023 and creation of an
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/capi-working-group/problems">inventory of problems with the C API</a> at the 2023 core developer sprint.</p>
<p>Two inaugural C API working group members, Petr Viktorin and Victor Stinner,
presented back-to-back talks on the C API and gave context on what’s been
happening in the past year.</p>
<section id="what-does-the-c-api-working-group-do">
<h2>What does the C API working group do?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-the-c-api-working-group-do" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first of the two C API talks was given by Petr Viktorin on the “Native
Interface” and some of the first steps towards an idealized C API.</p>
<p>Petr started off by explaining that the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/capi-workgroup">C API working
group</a> makes two types of decisions: what
functionality to expose via the C API and how to expose it. Petr also
explained that the C API working group keeps two separate issue trackers, one
for incremental “<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/capi-workgroup/api-evolution/issues">evolution</a>” of the C API and another for
“<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/capi-workgroup/api-revolution/issues">revolution</a>”, a
place where more “radical” ideas are discussed.</p>
<p>The existing C API wasn’t designed with the knowledge, context, and needs of
today (like free-threading), but there are many good parts of the C API. Petr
explained that one of the more impactful things the working group has done is
to formalize “guidelines to get consistency with the good parts of the
existing API”.</p>
<p>Petr gave an example of what can go wrong with the PyLong_GetSign() function.
This API has a baked-in type check that can’t be avoided due to its function
signature and thus incurs a performance penalty _even when the caller has
already checked whether the object is the correct <a href="#id8"><span class="problematic" id="id9">type_</span></a>.</p>
<p>This extra performance penalty means that CPython itself uses its own private
API which avoids the type check, but this extra private API only for CPython
isn’t a great experience. Other languages and projects want access to the more
performant API, too.</p>
<p>Petr went on to reference Mark Shannon’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/markshannon/New-C-API-for-Python">proposal for a New C
API</a> which Petr called
“close to perfect” with caveats around not dropping existing APIs and the
name, instead suggesting “Native Interface” for the name of the new C API.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately we need to keep the old API around. We can’t just remove a
chunk of the existing API just because it’s old”, Petr lamented. Petr also
noted that not being able to remove parts of the existing API might mean that
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/faster-cpython/">Faster CPython</a> project loses some
incentive to work on the new C API.</p>
<p>C API decisions are made on three axes: performance, safety, and convenience.
Petr argued that of the three, “performance should be prioritized”, because a
convenient and safe layer can be built on top of a performant API with the
right amount of context.</p>
</section>
<section id="annotating-the-existing-c-api">
<h2>Annotating the existing C API<a class="headerlink" href="#annotating-the-existing-c-api" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Petr noted that we have experience within Python for adding a safety layer on
top of APIs in Python: <em>type hints</em>! Type hints in Python provide context
into an API’s inputs and outputs that can be checked using external tooling
without incurring a performance penalty on runtime.</p>
<p>Petr proposed adding annotations to C function signatures for function
behaviors like “returns a null pointer on error” or “never returns a null
pointer” which can then be used in other contexts like documentation or borrow
checking. Among the proposed annotations were some about whether references
were borrowed, stolen, or a new reference, which can be used to check
consistency of references.</p>

List of possible annotations for C API functions</p>
<p>Petr also noted that many of these annotations apply not only to new APIs but
to existing APIs as well. Implementing these annotations as empty C macros
means that behavior and performance isn’t impacted but can be parsed from
header files.</p>

Petr’s slides showing the annotations in use as C macros</p>
<p>To go along with these new annotations, Petr proposed writing a tool similar
to <a class="reference external" href="https://devguide.python.org/development-tools/clinic">Argument Clinic</a>.
Argument Clinic is a tool maintained by the CPython team which automatically
generates boilerplate code like function signatures and argument unpacking
based on input instructions.</p>
<p>Mark Shannon asked to clarify whether the priority was to improve the C API or
document existing behavior. Petr’s plan was to add annotation information to
the existing API and to wait on implementing the new Native Interface until
later. This plan wouldn’t change the behavior of any existing API, but APIs
which aren’t conforming would receive a new variant that conforms to the new C
API standards.</p>
<p>Victor Stinner asked whether the annotation information would be stored in a
separate file. Petr noted that a separate file is the plan to make it easier
to wrap the API and to avoid needing to parse header files directly.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3">PyO3</a> maintainer David Hewitt asked whether the
plan was to include variations that avoid type checks for all C API functions
to dodge the performance penalty for C API wrappers. David noted that PyO3
implemented many C API function calls as methods on wrapped objects. This
means that the type check was implicit and thus could avoid having types
checked again by the C API function. David also clarified that these extra
checks “aren’t a major performance drag” but would be great to remove the
inefficiencies if possible.</p>
<p>Petr answered that wrappers will need to wait for the Native Interface to be
implemented to expose the underlying C API functions which don’t include type
checks.</p>
<p>There was enthusiastic agreement from the room about using annotation
information for documentation and automatically generating boilerplate code
and checks along with being able to do borrow checking using annotation
information.</p>

<section id="limited-c-api">
<h2>Limited C API<a class="headerlink" href="#limited-c-api" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The second C API talk was given by Victor Stinner on the status of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#limited-c-api">Limited C API</a>.
The Limited C API is a subset of the Python C API that’s consistent across
different versions of Python. The Limited C API can be opted-in to using
define Py_LIMITED_API, by doing so only <em>public</em> functions of the limited C
=============================================================================
API can be used.</p>
<p>Victor started off by listing his long-term goals for the Python C API, which
mostly focused on reducing friction both for maintainers of the Python C API
and for third parties using the API or updating to support new Python
versions. One possibility to achieve this would be to “move to using the
Limited C API by default and use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable-abi">Stable
ABI</a> for everybody”
but Victor noted this is a “very long term goal”.</p>
<p>Getting to this goal is challenging because it’s difficult to know how a given
change will affect the ecosystem of Python projects, both for finding affected
projects and how widespread breakage would be for users. Victor explained that
each change typically only requires “1-10 lines of code changed per impacted
project” to fix issues.</p>

Trying to move all functions from private to either public or internal</p>
<p>Victor’s biggest project currently is to remove private functions from the C
API, specifically functions which begin with an underscore “_” by convention.
Victor explained that he removed all 300 private functions starting with “_Py”
for 3.13.0-alpha1 to discover how and where private APIs are used by
downstream projects. Victor and team anticipated that this mass-removal would
cause breakages, so after the initial round of discovery the removed functions
causing the most issues have been re-added in 3.13.0-alpha2.</p>
<p>As of 3.13.0-beta1, 264 functions of the over 300 functions are still removed.
The functions which have been added back are not simply left as-is either:
once a private function is discovered the C API working group gets a chance to
design a _new public C API <a href="#id10"><span class="problematic" id="id11">function_</span></a> for projects to use instead.</p>
<p>“The goal isn’t to annoy people, the goal is to provide better functions for
everybody” – Victor Stinner</p>
<p>These new public C API functions would have documentation, tests, backwards
compatibility guarantees, and can benefit from the new C API working group
guidelines around API design. Victor gave an example of the PyDict_Pop() API
which previously required checking for an error condition using
PyErr_Occurred() to disambiguate between a key not being in the dictionary or
if any other error occurred.</p>
<p>The new PyDict_Pop() function returns -1, 0, and 1 for the “error”, “not
found”, and “found” cases respectively in accordance with new C API guidelines
meaning a call to PyErr_Ocurred() is avoided.</p>

New PyDict_Pop() public function with improvements</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://pythoncapi-compat.readthedocs.io">pythoncapi-compat project</a>,
which Victor is a maintainer of, provides backfills for these new 3.13 APIs
for Python 3.12 and older. This means that projects can immediately start
taking advantage of new APIs which are better designed and return strong
references. Victor highlighted in particular PyDict_GetItemRef() and others
which are new in 3.13 and are important for free-threading due to
PyDict_GetItem() returning a borrowed reference instead of a new strong
reference.</p>

Slide from Victor’s presentation on current Limited C API adoption</p>
<p>The biggest users of the Python C API like Cython, PyO3, pybind, and more are
at various stages of supporting the Limited C API, most of which require an
opt-in for builds.</p>
<p>Victor’s top project in coming months and years will be to move the C API away
from using structures (“C structs”) like PyFrameObject, PyThreadState, and
PyTypeObject. Victor noted that projects like Cython, greenlet, gevent, and
more have to access directly into structure members which can cause breakages
when upgrading to new Python versions. Victor explained that there is no way
to handle this with the Limited C API today. “We already provide many helper
functions like getters and setters, but we need to provide even more” said
Victor as a way forwards on this issue.</p>
<p>Petr questioned the approach of “breaking current projects so that future
Python versions don’t break them”, saying that it’d be better to warn projects
about using private API functions that aren’t supported and wait to introduce
breaking changes when it’s necessary to progress the C API.</p>
<p>Victor replied that he’d already started work on a PEP to opt-in for build
errors when a project is using deprecated functions, “like a strict mode for
the C API”. Victor agreed that the current plan isn’t great in this way, “we
ask people to update their code and the timeline is very short, we expect
people to update in one years time” noting the circumstances where this can be
difficult such as unmaintained projects or solo-maintainers.</p>
<p>Petr also added here that the opt-in would need to be versioned per Python
version, so users can have control over when they want to do the work to move
to new C API functions.</p>
<p>Eric Snow and Mark Shannon remarked on a more incremental strategy. This
strategy would see deprecated functions moved structurally into a separate
file (“legacy.c” and “legacy.h”) but with the behavior preserved to have a
clearer idea of what functions Python developers want to remove. After being
moved the functions would be implemented using newly designed APIs where
possible. Others noted that this would only be a convenience for core
developers and projects that are interested in internals like PyO3 and Cython.</p>
<p>David Hewitt commented on the long feedback cycles, as downstream projects of
the Stable ABI are still using Python 3.7 as a target, so any changes to the
Stable ABI may not receive feedback until many years later. Victor responded
that he’s working on a new project that implements new functions of Python for
old Python versions.</p>
<p>Overall, the work and proposals presented by both Petr and Victor were well-
received by the room. It’s clear that the Python C API is in good hands with
the C API working group and is moving in the right direction to solve
tomorrow’s problems.</p>
