<h1>PSF Grants Program 2022 &amp; 2023 Transparency Report<a class="headerlink" href="#psf-grants-program-2022-2023-transparency-report" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/05/psf-grants-program-2022-2023.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The PSF’s Grants Program is a key plank in our charitable mission to promote,
protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and
facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python
programmers. After much research, input, and analysis, we are pleased to share
a PSF Grants Program 2022 &amp; 2023 Transparency Report. The report includes
context, numbers, analysis, and a proposed path forward. It also includes a
supplemental analysis of several specific grant applications for which we were
requested to share more information.</p>
<p>We feel it is important to acknowledge that Pythonistas, regional communities,
and the broader community are behind these statistics and commentary. Our
community called for this report to be created. While the report is focused on
data and outcomes, we also feel it is important to acknowledge in this
introduction the concerns and frustrations that brought us here, explained
further in the ‘Setting context’ section below. We hope that this report,
along with many other steps, helps to remediate this.</p>
<p>This report reflects the outcome of thousands of hours of PSF and volunteer
efforts over 2022 and 2023 by the Grants Working Group, the PSF Board, Python
organizers, and PSF Staff worldwide. We truly value this opportunity to share
information on the last two years of increasing grants to the community and to
improve our Grants Program while honoring the hard work of everyone involved
in making the Program and our mission possible.</p>
<p>This report was compiled by PSF Staff and reviewed by the PSF Board and Grants
Working Group. If you have questions, comments, or feedback about the Grants
Program or this report, please email
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:grants&#37;&#52;&#48;pyfound&#46;org">grants<span>&#64;</span>pyfound<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.</p>
<section id="setting-context">
<h2>Setting context<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-context" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In December of 2023, we received an <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html">open
letter</a> from a coalition of organizers from the pan-African Python
community asking the PSF to address concerns and frustrations around our
Grants Program. Before receiving the letter, the PSF Board was aware of the
Grant application that spurred this letter and published a <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/10/september-october-board-votes.html">transparency blog
post</a>
regarding the September and October 2023 Board votes concerning that
application. PSF Staff were aware of a need for a refresh of Grants Program
documentation and processes and worked on these updates time allowing. Since
receiving the letter in December, the PSF Board and Staff have:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Spent time listening during many discussions with the letter writers and other community members.</p></li>
<li><p>Re-prioritized reviewing and rewriting Grant-related documentation and processes, including revisiting the Grants Working Group Charter.</p></li>
<li><p>Established monthly <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/introducing-psf-grants-office-hours.html">Grants Program Office Hours</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Contracted Carol Willing to perform a <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/03/djangocon-africa-grant-process.html">DjangoCon Africa Grants Process Retrospective</a> which is now available on the PSF Blog.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For a high-level idea of the scope of our Grants Program, we are happy to
share:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The PSF distributed $393K in Grants during 2022 and $623K during 2023 for the Grants Program and the PyCon US Travel Grants Program combined.</p></li>
<li><p>The Grants Program distributed $215K in Grants during 2022 and $393K during 2023.</p></li>
<li><p>_Noting this Transparency Report is focused on the Grants Program only. If you want to learn more about travel grants check out the`Travel Grants Process for PyCon US 2024 blog post &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/03/TravelGrantsReport2024.html">https://pycon.blogspot.com/2024/03/TravelGrantsReport2024.html</a>&gt;`_ on the PyCon US blog. _</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The growth we saw from 2022 to 2023 is exciting to reflect on, and we’re
looking forward to what 2024 and beyond has in store for our Grants Program!</p>

<li><p>The percentages across continents are reasonably balanced, with fewer applications from Asia, North America, and Oceania. Based on the distribution of populations globally, the percentage of applications from Asia is lower than expected. After receiving input on this directly from PyCon organizers from Asia, we have come to understand that this is based on an approach focused on sustainability. PyCon organizers in Asia are focused on local sponsorship, fiscal responsibility, and independence. We absolutely commend this approach, and at the same time, we urge organizers from Asia to request Grant funding to supplement and enhance their events.</p></li>

Conferences typically cost significantly more than meetups. Here’s a breakdown:</p></li>

<li><p>Oceania is an outlier; the PSF received one application in 2022 and two in 2023 from Oceania. Many more grants were awarded to other regions, which caused their average dollar amount to be lower. With that in mind, we feel the average is reasonable. It means that we are receiving both large and small grant applications!</p></li>

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The majority of the average grant review period is 4 weeks, which we feel is reasonable based on the process and load of grant applications we receive.</p></li>
<li><p>When we reviewed applications that took longer than 4 weeks to decide, we found a couple of scenarios.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the main reasons for longer decision times is that applications are sometimes submitted without crucial information, and there is significant time spent on communications between applicants, PSF Staff, and the Grants Working Group. Once requested, there are often delays in receiving the required information back from applicants.</p></li>
<li><p>The grant application was escalated to the Board who meet on a monthly basis. Grants can be escalated to the Board either because the amount requested is greater than $10,000 or because the Grants Working Group cannot reach a consensus on a decision.</p></li>

<li><p>In 2023, applications from Asia took longer to reach decisions. When we looked into this further, we found that the reasons for delays were that applications were submitted without the required information and that significant time was spent on communications between applicants, PSF Staff, and the Grants Working Group.</p></li>

<h3>Our comments<a class="headerlink" href="#our-comments" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We do not have many insights into the administration of these Grant requests
outside of what exists on the GWG mailing list, including any off list emails
or in-person conversations that might have occurred. The PSF Staff
administering the GWG for the grant requests from 2018 and 2019 are no longer
on the team. The request from 2022, which was approved, was 2 days over our
goal of 6 week turnaround time for decisions on grant applications.</p>
<p>While our staff roster is currently small, it was <em>even</em> smaller in 2018 and
2019. We realized some time ago that as our grant requests increased having a
solo administrator for the GWG was tough- it was hard for our staff to catch a
break! When we put out a call for a Community Communications Manager in June
of 2023, we planned for whoever stepped into that role to be a second
administrator for the GWG to always have a stopgap at the ready. Our current
administration for the GWG now includes two PSF Staff members. This is done
purposefully to avoid situations where applications get dropped because a
critical piece of information comes just as someone is scheduled to be out of
the office or an emergency happens.</p>

<h2>A final note<a class="headerlink" href="#a-final-note" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We hope this transparency report will help our community understand the state
of our Grants Program over the last two years. It has been instructive to the
Board, the Grants Working Group, and our staff who administer the program to
understand where our strengths and weaknesses lay. This report will inform our
efforts as we progress with improvements to the Grants Program. We also feel
this exercise will continue to be helpful year over year, to both monitor the
health of and analyze how our improvement efforts have impacted the success of
the Grants Program.</p>
