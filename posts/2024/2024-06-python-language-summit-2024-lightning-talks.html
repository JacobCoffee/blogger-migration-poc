<h1>The Python Language Summit 2024: Lightning Talks<a class="headerlink" href="#the-python-language-summit-2024-lightning-talks" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/python-language-summit-2024-lightning-talks.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Python Language Summit 2024 closed off with six lightning talks which were
all submitted during the Language Summit. The talks were delivered by Petr
Viktorin, David Hewitt, Emily Morehouse, Łukasz Langa, Pablo Galindo Salgado,
and Yury Selivanov.</p>

<h2>Petr Viktorin: Unsupported build warning<a class="headerlink" href="#petr-viktorin-unsupported-build-warning" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Do you know what happens when you build Python on an unsupported platform?</p>
<p>“… _It works!_ “ – Thomas Wouters</p>
<p>Petr gave a short presentation on a warning that many folks using Python (and
even developing Python!) may have never seen before: the unsupported build
warning. This warning appears when building on a platform that’s <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0011/#support-tiers">not
officially supported by CPython</a>, for example “riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu”.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvkJZG2Hef6Q1_gBbnMa8D8-2vH2pZutdxA2dwMf0ptLy5hVYWPqlqVe6p5Bo1H-E2GL3G0ocf58y89LambQpnac-4Hl6SeGBkQj-4TO6wlqkmp5DCT_fJbzSTuN-4bo3ARtbIsw-C1sDrlOdkRkdGkzoeBZwYENDfZ2JqpWOI6bK9My_H-A/s320/20240515_163830.jpg">![</a>](<a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvkJZG2Hef6Q1_gBbnMa8D8-2vH2pZutdxA2dwMf0ptLy5hVYWPqlqVe6p5Bo1H-E2GL3G0ocf58y89LambQpnac-4Hl6SeGBkQj-4TO6wlqkmp5DCT_fJbzSTuN-4bo3ARtbIsw-C1sDrlOdkRkdGkzoeBZwYENDfZ2JqpWOI6bK9My_H-A/s4000/20240515_163830.jpg">https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvkJZG2Hef6Q1_gBbnMa8D8-2vH2pZutdxA2dwMf0ptLy5hVYWPqlqVe6p5Bo1H-E2GL3G0ocf58y89LambQpnac-4Hl6SeGBkQj-4TO6wlqkmp5DCT_fJbzSTuN-4bo3ARtbIsw-C1sDrlOdkRkdGkzoeBZwYENDfZ2JqpWOI6bK9My_H-A/s4000/20240515_163830.jpg</a>)

“The platform is not supported, use at your own risk”
(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)</p>
<p>Just because a platform isn’t officially supported by CPython doesn’t mean it
won’t work on that platform, and indeed it’s likely that CPython may work fine
on the platform or a subset of features may be subtly or not-so-subtly broken
or unavailable.</p>
<p>Petr wanted to get a temperature check from the group on whether this warning
could be further improved or changed, such as by hiding the warning after the
user had executed the test suite or showing the number of tests that had
failed.</p>
<p>The room seemed mostly uninterested in exploring this topic further and was in
favor of keeping the warning as-is.</p>

<section id="david-hewitt-rust-in-python-panic">
<h2>David Hewitt: Rust in Python: panic!<a class="headerlink" href="#david-hewitt-rust-in-python-panic" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>David Hewitt maintains the project PyO3 which offers Rust bindings for the
Python C API. David explained that these bindings require mapping concepts in
the Rust programming language to Python and the topic of today’s talk is the
<a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html">panic!</a> macro.</p>
<p>In Rust, the panic! macro will generate a panic, unwind the stack, and then
terminate the program while providing feedback to the caller of the program.
David showed that there were <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html#when-to-use-panic-vs-result">two methods of handling
errors</a> in Rust programs, <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html">panic!</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html">Result</a>.</p>
<p>Python functions implemented in Rust use the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/prelude/type.PyResult.html">PyResult</a> type
to contain the return value or raised exception which uses the Rust Result
type. But what if a Rust function panics, what should PyO3 do?</p>
<p>Today PyO3 raises a separate exception for panics,
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyo3_runtime.PanicException">pyo3_runtime.PanicException</a> to be exact.
This exception inherits from
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#BaseException">BaseException</a>,
typically reserved for exceptions that users won’t want to catch like
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt">KeyboardInterrupt</a>
and
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit">SystemExit</a>.</p>
<p>David has been receiving feedback from some users that the PanicException
inheriting from BaseException is annoying to work with. This is because
everywhere that exceptions are caught now needs to also catch PyO3’s
PanicException, giving the example case of logging exceptions.</p>
<p>David wanted feedback on whether the original choice to inherit from
BaseException was appropriate or if there was a better answer.</p>
<p>Pablo Galindo Salgado asked whether an AssertError or RuntimeError would be
more appropriate. David replied that he felt that not inheriting from
BaseException would “cheapen” the Rust aspect of a panic.</p>
<p>Guido van Rossum offered that he thinks “BaseException is the correct choice”,
to which there was much agreement from the room.</p>

<h2>Emily Morehouse: Formalizing the PEP prototype process<a class="headerlink" href="#emily-morehouse-formalizing-the-pep-prototype-process" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python Steering Council Member and Language Summit chair, Emily Morehouse,
spoke to the group about the PEP prototype process and how formalizing can
better support PEP authors.</p>

<p>Emily started off the talk stating “We all agree that we should be doing more
testing and prototyping outside of CPython”. She also referenced prior talks
like pdb improvements and subinterpreters where this approach was recommended.</p>
<p>Emily noted that the Steering Council has pronounced this as a requirement for
PEP authors. She acknowledged that this “can feel a bit bad as a PEP author to
be put out into the dark world of figuring out how to gather feedback from the
community” and how to manage and distribute a project.</p>
<p>Emily’s proposal for improving the PEP process borrows from the <a class="reference external" href="https://tc39.es">TC39
process</a>, which is the process for making changes and
improvements to JavaScript. The proposal would see the prototype process be
made an “official optional step of the  PEP process” which would then allow
creating a separate GitHub repository within the
“<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/">python</a>” GitHub organization.</p>
<p>This would allow the project to house its own code, issue tracker, and
packages would be distributed by the Python organization instead of on
someone’s personal account. Emily also suggested providing a template for the
repository to handle distributions to PyPI.</p>
<p>Emily’s theory is that PEPs would see more adoption and get more feedback if
they came from an official channel. This approach provides additional support
to PEP author and lets the author start gathering community feedback quicker
before waiting for PEP pronouncement.</p>
<p>The room was in agreement for moving forward with the process improvement.</p>
<p>Carol Willing thought the improvement would be great but called back to
pattern matching for CPython where the work was done in a feature branch of
the CPython repository rather than a separate repository. Carol thought using
a feature branch worked well for pattern matching and wanted to know how this
process might work for future language changes.</p>
<p>Emily replied that the process would be case-by-case depending on the feature
whether it’s a branch, fork or something else. Thomas Wouters agreed, saying
that this proposal appears to be specifically for projects which could be
distributed on the PyPI instead of language features.</p>

<h2>Łukasz Langa: Python for iOS, finally<a class="headerlink" href="#lukasz-langa-python-for-ios-finally" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Harking back to the previous talk on mobile support for Python, Łukasz wanted
to know if the Python team should have a more official presence on phone
application stores like the Apple App Store (and maybe the Google Play Store,
but Łukasz declined to speak on it since he is an iOS user).</p>
<p>Łukasz noted that there already exists today multiple applications on his
phone that “are Python”. These applications are useful for trying out Python
code, learning Python, and writing small programs.</p>
<p>However Łukasz noted that by not having an official Python application on
mobile meant the user experience today is sub-optimal. Some applications are
publishing old versions of Python and aren’t reachable when being asked to
upgrade to newer versions so users can take advantage of new features. Others
have suddenly changed from being free to being paid applications. Should the
Python development team do something about this?</p>
<p>The response from the room appeared positive, but acknowledged the amount of
effort that creating and maintaining such an application would be.</p>
<p>Russell Keith-Magee, the author of BeeWare which is leading the charge to
bring Python to mobile platforms, said “Sure, but I’m not building it”. After
much laughter from the room, Russell noted that the project is “an entirely
achievable goal but not a small one”.</p>
<p>Ned Deily, macOS release expert, agreed and offered that “implementing a
terminal would get us most of the way there”.</p>

You’ll have to imagine the iconic Pablo “✨ woooooow ✨”
(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)</p>
<p>Pablo took the term “lightning talk” to heart and gave a 90 second
presentation (demo included!) on his plans to improve asserts in Python in
version 3.14. The problem statement was summarized as “asserts are kinda sad”,
after which Pablo showed how when an assert statement fails there isn’t much
indication about _why_ the condition failed in the error.</p>
<p>Consider how an assertion error might look today:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Traceback (most recent call last):</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>File “main.py”, line 7, in &lt;module&gt;</dt><dd><p>bar(x, y)
~~~^^^^^^</p>
</dd>
<dt>File “main.py”, line 3, in bar</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>assert (x + 1) + z == y</dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>AssertionError</p>
<p>Pretty opaque! In the above example you’ll notice that we can’t see the values
of x, y, or z which makes evaluating what went wrong difficult. Instead, with
Pablo’s proposed changes the traceback would look like so:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Traceback (most recent call last):</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>File “main.py”, line 7, in &lt;module&gt;</dt><dd><p>bar(x, y)
~~~^^^^^^</p>
</dd>
<dt>File “main.py”, line 3, in bar</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>assert (x + 1) + z == y</dt><dd></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>AssertionError: assert ((1 + 1) + 11) == 2</p>
<p>With this change the values are visible for the asserted statement. Similarly
being able to inspect containers to show where their contents differ, a-la
pytest:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Traceback (most recent call last):</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>File “main.py”, line 2, in bar</dt><dd><p>assert x == y</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>AssertionError: assert Lists differ: [1, 2, 3, [1, 2]] != [1, 2, 3, [1, 3]]</p>
<p>First differing element 3:
[1, 2]
[1, 3]</p>
<p>- [1, 2, 3, [1, 2]]
?               ^</p>
<p>+ [1, 2, 3, [1, 3]]
?</p>
<p>Pablo intends to put together a PEP for this feature, including asking
questions like whether the process should be hookable and whether user code
should be able to provide custom formatters. Stay tuned for that!</p>

<h2>Yury Selivanov: Efficient data sharing between subinterpreters<a class="headerlink" href="#yury-selivanov-efficient-data-sharing-between-subinterpreters" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final talk of the Language Summit was from Yury Selivanov on
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edgedb/memhive">Memhive</a>, a new “highly experimental”
project which adds support for structured data sharing between Python
subinterpreters.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html#pep-684-a-per-interpreter-gil">Per-Interpreter
GIL</a> is a newer feature to Python that allows running multiple “interpreters”
in a single instance of Python each with their own Global Interpreter Lock
(GIL). Per-interpreter GIL allows for true multi-core parallelism, previously
using threads in a Python process would only allow a single Python instruction
to execute at a time due to the GIL being shared across all threads.</p>
<p>Being in the same process means that each subinterpreter is sharing the same
memory space, and if instructions are executing truly concurrently we run into
problems with that shared memory space. PEP 684 which specifies per-
interpreter GIL <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/#memory-allocators">calls out this
issue</a> and for now keeps
memory allocators using global locking mechanisms.</p>
<p>Yury started the talk by discussing immutable data structures and their
properties, the most interesting being how quickly they can be copied in
memory. Deep copies are fast for immutable data structures because they are
implemented as a single copy-by-reference.</p>
<p>An immutable mapping collection, specifically a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie">hash-array mapped
trie</a> (HAMT), has
already been implemented in Python for the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html">contextvars
module</a>. Context variables

Yury explaining how to replant a trie 🌲
(Photo credit: Hugo van Kemenade)</p>
<p>HAMTs work by transparently updating the trie structure in background of the
mapping allowing for structured sharing while minimizing overhead to create
new copies.</p>
<p>The invariant for this to work across subinterpreters is that the immutable
collection in the main interpreter must not be garbage collected. Maintaining
this invariant will require reliable reference counting across subinterpreters
(“remote IncRef”). The proposed implementation would have every subinterpreter
maintain multiple queues for tracking local and remote reference counts.</p>
<p>Yury explained that similar to how HAMTs provide an immutable mapping
collection there is another data structure for immutable list collections
which is “just another 5,000 lines of C” (which received some chuckles) and
“luckily we won’t be the first ones to implement this collection”.</p>
<p>After comparing the performance of pickling mappings or using mappings with
immutable data structures showed that immutable data structures were much more
performant. The performance was better for immutable mappings for both small
and large numbers of keys, between 6x and a “ridiculous” 150,000x faster.</p>
<p>“I believe these are the missing components for subinterpreters”, Yury noted
with many thanks to Eric Snow who has been working on subinterpreters and per-
interpreter GIL for years. Yury concluded that this work is being done with a
practical use-case in mind so will be completed and usable for others
including CPython.</p>
<p>For folks looking for more on this topic, Yury also <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/67/">gave a talk at PyCon US
2024</a> about his work on
Memhive.</p>
