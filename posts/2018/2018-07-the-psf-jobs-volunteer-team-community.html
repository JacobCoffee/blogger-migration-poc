<h1>The PSF Jobs Volunteer Team: Community Service Award Q1 2018 Recipient<a class="headerlink" href="#the-psf-jobs-volunteer-team-community-service-award-q1-2018-recipient" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/07/the-psf-jobs-volunteer-team-community.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The popularity of the Python language has increased exponentially in recent
years. Notably, <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/">Stack
Overflow</a>
highlighted Python as the fastest growing major programming language. As
Pythonistas, we know why: Python is easy to learn, solves real world problems
in a variety of fields, and has an amazingly friendly community.</p>
<p>With its success, companies around the world are using Python to build and
improve their products, creating a growing need for people that know – or are
willing to learn – the language. Today you can see Python’s popularity
reflected in the growing supply of Python-related jobs with a quick internet
search. Or you can head over to the the Python official site and look at the
Python Jobs board! Created in 2010 as a way to connect developers and
companies, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/jobs/">Python Jobs</a> board was
relaunched in early 2015 and has since been run by an awesome team of
volunteers.</p>
<p>It’s with great pride that the Python Software Foundation has awarded Jon
Clements, Melanie Jutras, Rhys Yorke, Martijn Pieters, and Marc-Andre Lemburg
with the Q1 2018 Community Service Award:</p>
<p>&gt; _RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the Q1 2018 Community
&gt; Service Award to the following members of the PSF Jobs Volunteer Team for
&gt; the many hours they have contributed to reviewing and managing the hundreds
&gt; of job postings submitted on an annual basis: Jon Clements, Melanie Jutras,
&gt; Rhys Yorke, Martijn Pieters, and Marc-Andre Lemburg._</p>
<section id="psf-jobs-volunteer-team-a-team-of-dedicated-volunteers">
<h2>PSF Jobs Volunteer Team: A Team of Dedicated Volunteers<a class="headerlink" href="#psf-jobs-volunteer-team-a-team-of-dedicated-volunteers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a job poster, all you need to do is register on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/accounts/signup/">Python
website</a> and create a job posting
filling out the required information. Then, the Jobs Volunteer Team will
review them one by one against a list of criteria – such as text format, the
job description and how it is related to Python. The entry can be
automatically published or sent back to its author with a review note. The
process may seem simple, but imagine doing that for hundreds of jobs each year
- that’s a lot of responsibility!</p>
<p>The PSF Jobs Volunteer team has five members, including members Marc Andre and
Rhys York.</p>
<p>Marc-Andre is the CEO and founder of eGenix.com, a Python-focused project and
consulting company based in Germany. He has a degree in mathematics from the
University of Düsseldorf.
His work with Python started in 1994.</p>
<p>As a Python Core Developer, Marc-Andre designed and implemented the Unicode
support in Python 2.0, and authored the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.egenix.com/products/python/">mx
Extensions</a>. He is also the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.europython-society.org/">EuroPython Society (EPS)</a> Chair, a
Python Software Foundation (PSF) founding Fellow and co-founded a local Python
meeting in Düsseldorf (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.pyddf.de/">PyDDF</a>). He served on the board
of the PSF and EPS for many terms and loves to contribute to the growth of
Python wherever he can.</p>
<p>Rhys grew up in a small town in Ontario, Canada where he developed a passion
for drawing, writing and technology.</p>
<p>He began working in 1999 on Marvel Comics’ Deadpool, and since that time has
had the opportunity to work on ThunderCats, G.I. Joe, Battle of the Planets,
and a number of exciting properties. He works in the film, television and
video game industries - notably on Funcom’s “The Secret World”, Drinkbox’s
“Tales from Space: About a Blob” and Ubisoft’s “FarCry 5”.
Rhys recently wrapped on the third season of the science-fiction television
series “The Expanse” as well as on the film “Polar”. Rhys is also currently
working as Art Director at Brown Bags Films on an undisclosed animation
project. As if that wasn’t enough, Rhys teaches Python to children and adults
as well. Rhys is very passionate about promoting programming literacy.</p>

<h2>Engagement, Challenges and the Future of the Python Job Board<a class="headerlink" href="#engagement-challenges-and-the-future-of-the-python-job-board" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Explaining his involvement with the PSF Jobs Volunteer Team, Marc-Andre says,</p>
<p>&gt; “I took over the Job Boards project after the previous maintainer, Chris
&gt; Wither, left the project in 2013. I kickstarted the relaunch project in
&gt; February 2014 to migrate the old job board to the new platform.</p>
<p>&gt; The project was on hold for several months between August 2014 and January
&gt; 2015, but then picked up speed again and we were able to relaunch the Job
&gt; Board on March 19th 2015.</p>
<p>&gt; Since then a team of reviewers has been working hard to keep up with the
&gt; many job postings we get each day.”</p>
<p>The Jobs Team faced several challenges during the platform redesign, such as
managing the project, rethinking the review process, and finding people to
help and. Following the relaunch the team faced additional challenges in
keeping up with processing all the job posts that were remaining in the
backlog.</p>
<p>As for the future of the Team, Rhys wants to continue providing a service to
the Python community and Marc-Andre has worked with the PSF to turn the group
into a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf/committees/#python-job-board-work-group">PSF Working Group</a> as of July 24, 2018. This change will enable to group to get
more recognition from the PSF and the Python community at large.</p>

<h2>How you can get involved<a class="headerlink" href="#how-you-can-get-involved" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want contribute and be a part of the Team, Marc-Andre says:</p>
<p>Today, the job reviews are pretty easy to manage. We have laid out a set of
rules which work well and reviews don’t take long to do anymore. The process
is documented
<a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PSF%20Python%20Job%20Board/Reviewers">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are still a few rough edges in the system, so if there are Django
programmers willing to help, please get in contact with Berker Peksağ and
submit Pull Requests for the open issues we have on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/labels/job%20board">tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Rhys adds, “Do it. Even if you have little time, giving back to the community
is a rewarding experience.”</p>
