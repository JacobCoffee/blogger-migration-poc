<h1>PyConZA 2018 – a beautiful community in South Africa<a class="headerlink" href="#pyconza-2018-a-beautiful-community-in-south-africa" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/12/pyconza-2018-beautiful-community-in.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>This year I attended my second <a class="reference external" href="https://za.pycon.org/">PyConZA</a>, which is held
in Johannesburg, South Africa. It is the annual gathering of the South African
Python community that uses and develops the open source Python programming
language. It’s organized by the community for the community, fostering unique
solutions to the challenges faced in Africa. For the curious: ZA stands for
Zuid-Afrika, a Dutch abbreviation for South Africa.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to South Africa to attend PyConZA. I am from Brazil but I
struggle to resist a trip to South Africa to visit amazing friends, the
beautiful mountains, beaches, wine farms, great food, safaris, and more.</p>
<p>The South African conference, a conference ran entirely by a team of dedicated
volunteers, reached its eighth edition this year. As an added success this
year the conference reached an outstanding number of attendees.</p>
<section id="the-numbers">
<h2>The Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#the-numbers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Over five days – which included tutorials, main conference and sprints – the
conference received 255 attendees, boasting 100% growth compared to the last
time it was held in Johannesburg in 2015.</p>
<p>The main event counted three simultaneous tracks – plus daily open space
sessions. Collectively the conference had 41 speakers, 34 talks, 13 lightning
talks and 3 keynotes. The Data Science and Typing tutorials gathered 36
people. Roughly 15 attendees with hacker spirits joined the sprints and ate
pizza whilst working on various projects.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://womenintech.co.za/blog/">Women in Tech ZA</a> &amp; PyConZA gathered 13
attendees for their beginners friendly workshop “Python for Everyone”.</p>
<p>Sponsored by 11 entities – including companies such as Microsoft and Oracle –
the event had   lunch daily, a lounge with _really good <a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">coffee_</span></a> , juices and
mocktails – freshly made by professionals and available at all times – a
speaker’s dinner and lots of swag in the Birchwood Hotel Conference Center.</p>
<p>If a Python conference wasn’t enough, Johannesburg hosted at the same week and
venue, <a class="reference external" href="https://linuxconf.co.za/">LinuxConf</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://postgresconf.org/conferences/SouthAfrica2018">PostgresConf</a>, bringing
in yet more attendees, diversity and people walking around with three
different badges.</p>

<h2>Running a Conference Ain’t Easy!<a class="headerlink" href="#running-a-conference-ain-t-easy" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is what the conference organizers had to say about this year’s
conference:</p>
<p>David Sharpe, chair of the PyConZA 2017, said:</p>
<p>&gt; _PyConZA is a conference made for the community and by the community.
&gt; Getting people involved with it is relatively easy – getting people up to
&gt; speed with how to run a conference is the hard part. The same team has been
&gt; running the conference for the past seven years, and now our biggest
&gt; challenge is to spread this knowledge and show other people the ropes,
&gt; having redundancy in the committee and enabling PyConZA to move around the
&gt; country more._</p>
<p>Adam Piskorski, chair of this year’s edition, completed:</p>
<p>&gt; _Finding volunteers and chasing sponsors has been especially difficult when
&gt; most of the organizers are based in Cape Town – a city near the south most
&gt; part of the country. For the next year, we want a larger conference with
&gt; more optimized planning and execution._</p>

<p>The talk “<a class="reference external" href="https://2018.za.pycon.org/talks/74-python-community-development-in-east-africa/">Python Community Development in East
Africa</a>” is proof of how the Python programming language and community
is changing the world’s landscape and people’s life.  I’d encourage you to
take 40 minutes of your time and watch this, it’s inspirational.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-kato-3b09966a">Joshua Kato</a> (PSF Python
Ambassador in East Africa), <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/linuswamanya">Linus Wamanya</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/buwembo.murshid">Buwembo Murshid</a> showed us how
they are empowering the community in East Africa through training and
mentoring kids, students, and people with intellectual or physical
disabilities and refugees.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.afrodjangoinitiative.org/">AfroDjango</a> already has trained more
than 3000 people since 2015, from basic digital literacy to professional
software development. Projects such as home automation, online learning
platforms and an online market for hardware and sensors are being currently
developed by their students.</p>
<p>Today, AfroDjango has support from a variety of partners, including the PSF.
All of this amazing work has been recognized as “Promoting ICT practical
skills” by Uganda’s Head of State.</p>

<section id="financial-aid">
<h2>Financial Aid<a class="headerlink" href="#financial-aid" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Financial assistance is provided for those who might otherwise not be able to
attend the conference. Those potentially eligible were attendees with accepted
talks, attendees from South Africa and other African countries (especially
those from underprivileged backgrounds) and volunteers helping the conference.</p>
<p>This year, PyConZA was able to provide an amount of R40.000 (about US$2.700)
as financial aid for 7 attendees – 2 from South Africa, 3 from Mozambique, 1
from Nigeria and 1 from Uganda, 4 of them being women and 5 being speakers.
The organizing team used a points system to reward speakers, giving priority
to people from Africa and South Africa. They also wanted to choose people from
disadvantaged backgrounds, but the committee mentioned it proved difficult to
fairly ascertain that.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-video-team">
<h2>The Video Team<a class="headerlink" href="#the-video-team" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another highlight shared by all three events was the video recording crew.
Everything seemed magical and seamless. The video infrastructure organization
was led by Carl Karsten, a really cool Pythonista wearing hawaiian shorts from
Chicago, and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nextdayvideo.com/">Next Day Video</a> team.</p>
<p>They were able to record and livestream three simultaneous tracks using open
source software and even open source hardware. The recording interface was so
simple that volunteers (including me) could help with the job after just a two
minutes tutorial. On top of that, the videos were released on
<a class="reference external" href="http://archive.org/">Archive.org</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGjWYNrNnSuc78h5x23A5mLAzWlCl9LGf">Youtube</a>
in couple of _hours_ , with minimal manual intervention.</p>

<section id="the-python-software-society-of-south-africa">
<h2>The Python Software Society of South Africa<a class="headerlink" href="#the-python-software-society-of-south-africa" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The PyConZA organizing committee created <a class="reference external" href="http://pss-sa.org/">PSSSA</a> – a non-
profit organization – in May 2017. The objective is to support and grow the
Python community and events across the country, as well as manage and run
PyConZA.</p>
<p>Today it’s being used mainly as a legal and financial entity to support the
conference infrastructure, but the plans are to spread its influence and
facilitate Python groups throughout South Africa.</p>

<p>_PyConZA is awesome!_</p>
<p>I’d like to say thanks to the PyConZA organizing committee for helping me
gather all the information necessary to put this article together. It is
always a pleasure to hang out with you folks.</p>
<p>PyConZA 2019 is expected to be hosted once again in Johannesburg, in October
2019. I hope to see you there!</p>
