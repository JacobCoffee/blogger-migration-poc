<h1>The Happy Medium: Distinguished Service Award Winner Tim Peters<a class="headerlink" href="#the-happy-medium-distinguished-service-award-winner-tim-peters" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/07/the-happy-medium-distinguished-service.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>When Tim Peters started working on Python, his first advice for Guido van
Rossum was that programmers want to add ints and floats. From the beginning,
Python had both kinds of numbers, just like today, but adding them together
then required a cumbersome type-cast. Peters argued that Python should
implicitly convert ints to floats, like most other languages, for programmers’
sake: “That is a very common operation for anyone who works with floating
point numbers,” Van Rossum recalls him saying, “so you’ve got to do it this
way.”</p>
<p>Ever since, Peters has pushed the language in this direction. He insists that
Python should be a practical language that caters to the needs of programmers,
and he has a knack for guiding design debates to achieve this goal. In
recognition of his contributions, the PSF presented Tim Peters with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-distinguished-awards/#id1">the 2017
Distinguished Service Award</a>.</p>

<p><em>A Realist Algorithm</em></p>
<p>“Timsort is Tim’s grand opus,” says Van Rossum. The algorithm is not only the
standard sort for Python; when Java developer Joshua Bloch saw its merit for
sorting real-world data, he incorporated it into the Java standard library as
well. The genius of Timsort is to recognize how data naturally occurs in
everyday programs: it’s less likely to be randomly ordered than to be partly
ordered, or ordered in reverse. Programmers usually throw such data at a
sorting function anyway, and a theoretically elegant algorithm like Quicksort
won’t recognize the shortcuts it could take to save work. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">Timsort is designed
to recognize such opportunities</a> and
deploy efficient tricks for them.</p>
<p>Timsort is optimized for the world not as we imagine it, but as it is. This
realism is characteristic of the Python language as a whole. It flows from Van
Rossum’s taste in design, which Peters <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/1999-June/001951.html">distilled into a poem in
1999</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Zen of Python</em></p>
<p>It’s only 19 lines. But this short list of precepts has influenced the
language and the programs written in it profoundly. It is a shared literature
for Python programmers, in the same way that most English speakers know
certain lines of Shakespeare. Python’s designers quote the Zen of Python in
PEP debates, and programmers reviewing code in their own Python projects use
the Zen to support their opinions.</p>
<p>Guido van Rossum says, “You can use it to motivate a design choice, but it’s
not scripture. It can’t be the only reason to choose a particular design. You
still have to put your thinking cap on.” Just like the Zen Buddhist sayings
that inspired it, Peters’s text isn’t dogma. Indeed, for every commandment the
Zen of Python hands down, there is also a joke or a contradiction to remind us
to take it lightly.</p>
<p>Core developer Carol Willing summarizes the Zen of Python’s message like this:
“We’re going to meet constraints in a way that makes good common sense first,
so you can maintain the code and people can understand the code.” It’s this
commonsense approach that makes Python a joy to use. Willing began coding on a
mainframe at Bell Labs when she was in fifth grade in 1976; in all her years
as a programmer the most enjoyable have been her years with Python. She says,
“Every day I get to use it makes me feel like a kid again.” Now, when she
teaches Project Jupyter interns each summer, one of her first instructions is
to type “<a class="reference external" href="https://www.wefearchange.org/2010/06/import-this-and-zen-of-python.html">import this</a>”.</p>
<p>Willing extends Python’s Zen to its community, too. She says that “Beautiful
is better than ugly” is a good guide for talking with our colleagues. “There’s
an ugly way of saying things, and a more respectful, nicer way of saying
things. Maybe we should err on the side of being respectful and nice.”</p>

<p><em>A Happy Medium</em></p>
<p>In Guido van Rossum’s estimation, Peters’s biggest contribution to the
community has been his years of answering questions and guiding debates on the
Python mailing list, writing each message precisely and cheerfully. PSF
director Thomas Wouters agrees: “Tim is just never flustered. He always takes
it in good humor and it definitely has an effect on everyone else, as well.”
Even an experienced developer like Carol Willing says that when she sees a
post from Peters on a topic she knows, she’ll take the time to read it for new
insights or new ways of explaining.</p>
<p>In design debates, Peters invented a notion of “channeling Guido” to free Van
Rossum from the overflow of emails. He claimed to act like a spirit medium
speaking with Van Rossum’s voice, but this understates Peters’s influence. “He
was a mentor for me,” says Van Rossum. “He combines incredible technical
skills with insight into what the person he’s communicating with is missing or
needs to see, with a patient way of explaining. He showed me that style of
communicating which I strive for but can’t always do.”</p>
<p>Recently, in the wake of <a class="reference external" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/757713/">contentious
debate</a> over the “:=” operator, Guido van
Rossum resigned as BDFL. Tim Peters, too, is less active on Python mailing
lists than before. The Python community can no longer rely on one individual
and his channeler for guidance. As Brett Cannon
<a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005671.html">wrote</a>, “a key asset that Guido has provided for us
as a BDFL is consistency in design/taste.” As a summary of Van Rossum’s
thinking, the Zen of Python is now more important than ever.</p>
