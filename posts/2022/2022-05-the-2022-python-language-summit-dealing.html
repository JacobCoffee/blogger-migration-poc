<p>As the Python programming language continues to grow in popularity, so too
does the accumulation of issues and pull requests (“PRs”) on the CPython
GitHub repository. At time of writing (morning of 7th May, 2022), the total
stands at 7,027 <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues">open issues</a>, and
1,471 <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pulls">pull requests</a>. At <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit_01678898482.html">the 2022
Python Language Summit</a>, CPython Core Developer Irit Katriel gave a
talk on possible ways forward for dealing with the backlog.</p>

<p>Historically, there has been reluctance among CPython’s team of core
developers to close issues or PRs that may be of dubious worth. BPO-539907 was
presented to the audience as an issue that had remained open on the issue
tracker for over 20 years. The example is an extreme one, but represents a
pattern that anybody who has scrolled through the CPython issue tracker will
surely have seen before:</p>

page-003.jpg)</p>
<p>Anyone with experience in triaging issue trackers in open source will know
that it is not always easy to close an issue. People on the internet do not
always take kindly to being told that something they believe to be a bug is,
in fact, intended behaviour.</p>
<p>Low-quality feature requests can be even harder to tackle, and can be broadly
split into three buckets. The first bucket holds feature requests that simply
make no sense, or else would have actively harmful impacts – these can be
fairly easily closed. The second bucket holds feature requests that would add
maintenance costs, but would realistically add little value to end users.
These can often lead to tiresome back-and-forths – something one person may
see as a large problem in a piece of software may, ultimately, cause few
problems for the majority of users.</p>
<p>The feature requests that can linger on an issue tracker for twenty years,
however, are usually those in the third bucket: features that everybody can
agree might be nice if, in an ideal world, they were implemented – but that
nobody, ultimately, has the time or motivation to work on.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><ul>
<li><ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Katriel’s contention is that leaving an issue open on the tracker for 20 years
serves no one and that, instead, we should think harder about what an issue
tracker is actually _for_.</p>
<p>If the proposed <cite>tkinter</cite> lock from BPO-539907 is ever implemented, Katriel,
argues, “it’s not because of the twenty-year-old issue – it’s because somebody
will discover the need for it.” Rather than only closing issues that have
obvious defects, we should flip the script, and become far more willing to
close issues if they serve no obvious purpose. Issues should only be kept
_open_ if they serve an obvious purpose in helping further CPython’s
development. Instead of asking “Why should we close this?”, we should instead
ask, “Why should we keep this open?”</p>
<p>Citing a <a class="reference external" href="https://sundaylettersfromsam.substack.com/p/bonus-post-noisy-monitors?s=r">recent blog post</a> by Sam Schillace, Katriel argues that not only do
issues such as BPO-539907 (newly renamed as GH-36387, for those keeping tabs)
serve little purpose – they also do active harm to the CPython project.
Schillace argues that the problem of the “noisy monitor” – a term he uses for
any kind of feedback system where it becomes impossible to tell the signal
from the noise – is “one of the most pernicious, and common, patterns that
engineering teams fall prey to”. Leaving low-quality issues on a tracker,
Shillace argues, wastes the time of developers and triagers, and “obscures
both newer quality issues as well as the overall drift of the product.”</p>
<p>&gt; “It’s far better… to keep the tool clean for the things that matter.”
&gt;

<p>No one has done more work than Katriel over the past few years to keep the
issue tracker healthy, and her presentation was well received by the audience
of core devs and triagers. The question of where now to proceed, however, is
harder to tackle.</p>
<p>Pablo Galindo Salgado, an expert on CPython’s PEG parser, and the chief
architect behind the “Better error messages” project in recent years, noted
that he received “many, many issues” relating to possible changes to the
parser and improvements to error messages. “Every time you close an issue,” he
said, “People demand an explanation.” Arguing that maintainer time is “the
most valuable resource” in open-source software, Salgado said that the easiest
option was often just to leave it open.</p>
<p>However, hard though it may be to close an issue, ignoring open issues for an
extended period of time also does a disservice to contributors. Itamar
Ostricher – not a CPython core developer, but an experienced software engineer
who has worked for many years at Meta – said that the contributor experience
was “often confusing”. “Is this an issue where a PR would be accepted if I
wrote one? Does a core dev want to work on it?” Ostricher asked. Or is it just
a bad idea?</p>
<p>Ned Deily, release manager for Python 3.6 and 3.7, agreed, and argued that
CPython needed to become more consistent in how core devs treat issues and
PRs. Some modules, like <cite>tkinter</cite>, have been “ownerless” for a long time,
Deily argued. This can create a chicken-and-egg problem. If a module has no
maintainer, the solution is to add more maintainers. But a contributor can
only become a maintainer if they demonstrate their worth through a series of
merged PRs. And if a module has no active maintainer, there may be no core
devs who feel they have sufficient expertise to review and merge a PR relating
to the unmaintained module. So the contributor can never become a core
developer (as their PRs will never be merged), and the module will never gain
a new maintainer.</p>

<h2>Where now?<a class="headerlink" href="#where-now" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Various solutions were proposed to improve the situation. Katriel thought it
would be good to introduce a new “Accepted” label, that could be added by a
triager or a core developer. The idea is that the presence of the label
signifies that the core developer team is not waiting for any further
information from the issue filer: the bug report (or feature request) has been
acknowledged as valid.</p>
<p>Many attendees noted that the problem was in many ways a social problem rather
than a technical problem: the core development team needed a fundamental
change in mindset if they were to seriously tackle the issue backlog. Senthil
Kumaran argued that we should “err on the side of closing things”. Jelle
Zijlstra similarly argued that we needed to reach a place where it was
understood to be “okay” to close a feature request that had been open for many
years with no activity.</p>
<p>There was also, however, interest in improving workflow automation. Christian
Heimes discussed the difficulty of closing an issue or PR if you are a core
developer with English as a second language. Crafting the nuances of a
rejection notice so that it is polite but also clear can be a challenging
task. Ideas around automated messages from bots or canned responses were
discussed.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li></li>
</ul>

</ul>

</ul>
<p>The enormity of the task at hand is clear. Unfortunately, there is probably
not one easy fix that will solve the problem.</p>
<p>Things are already moving in a better direction, however, in many respects.
Łukasz Langa, CPython’s <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/07/ukasz-langa-is-inaugural-cpython.html">Developer-In-
Residence</a>, has been having a huge impact in stabilising the number of open
issues. The CPython triage team, a group of volunteers helping the core
developers maintain CPython, <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/six-new-triagers/">has also been significantly
expanded</a> in recent months,
increasing the workforce available to triage and close issues and PRs.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/">PEP 594</a>, deprecating several standard-
library modules that have been effectively unmaintained for many years, also
led to a large number of issues and PRs being closed in recent months. And the
transition to GitHub issues itself, which only took place a few weeks ago,
appears to have imbued the triage team with a new sense of energy.</p>
<p>Discussion continues on Discourse about further potential ways forward:</p>
