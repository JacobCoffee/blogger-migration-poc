<p>Jukka Lehtosalo described his work with Michael Sullivan on an experimental
compiler called mypyc.</p>
<p>The Python standard library, Lehtosalo said, contains the modules that most
programmers use by default, so it should be fast. The main optimization
technique has historically been to write C extensions. So far, 90 standard
library modules are partly or entirely written in C, often for the sake of
speed, totaling 200,000 lines of C code in the standard library. But C is hard
to write and error prone, and requires specialized skills. “C is kind of
becoming a dinosaur,” he said, provoking laughter from the core developers.</p>
<p>As an alternative, Lehtosalo proposes “writing C extensions in Python.” The
mypyc compiler reads PEP 484 annotated type-checked Python, and transforms it
into C extension modules that run between 2 and 20 times faster than pure
Python. Some of Python’s more dynamic features such as monkeypatching are
prohibited, and other features are not yet supported, but the project is
improving rapidly.</p>
<p>The project has a similar goal to Cython’s: to transform Python into C, which
is then compiled into extension modules. Compared to Cython, however, mypyc
supports a wider range of PEP 484 types such as unions and generics. In
Lehtosalo and Sullivan’s experiments it offers a greater performance
improvement. They propose further experimentation, testing how well mypyc
translates certain performance-sensitive standard library modules, such as
<cite>algorithms</cite>, <cite>random</cite>, or <cite>asyncio</cite>. The translated modules could be
published on PyPI first, rather than replacing the standard library modules
right away. If the test goes well, mypyc would offer “C-like performance with
the convenience of Python.”</p>
<p>Core developer Brett Cannon suggested an experiment using some module, such as
<cite>datetime</cite>, that is already implemented in both Python and C. The Python
version could be translated with mypyc and then pitted against the handwritten
C version.</p>

<p>Python’s interactive shell makes it easy for beginners to learn Python, and
for all Python programmers to experiment as they develop. However, async
Python code is practically unusable with the shell. The <cite>await</cite> keyword must
be used within a coroutine, so a programmer who wants the result of an a
waitable object must define a coroutine and run an event loop method to
execute it.</p>
<p>Matthias Bussonnier presented his work, which integrates <cite>async</cite> and <cite>await</cite>
into the alternative IPython shell. IPython permits the <cite>await</cite> keyword at the
top level, so a user can get the results of coroutines or other awaitables in
the shell without defining a coroutine:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In [1]: from asyncio import sleep</p>
<p>In [2]: await sleep(1)</p>
<p>In [3]: from aiohttp import ClientSession</p>
<p>In [4]: s = ClientSession()</p>
<p>In [5]: response = await s.get(’<a class="reference external" href="https://api.github.com">https://api.github.com</a>’)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>IPython supports asyncio and other async frameworks such as trio. In the
future, a plugin system will allow any <cite>async</cite>/<cite>await</cite>-based framework to be
usable in the shell.
Bussonnier argued that some of his ideas should be adopted by core Python. If
asynchronous coding were convenient in the shell, it would be useful for
educators, and it would remove what he considers the misconception that async
is hard. Best of all, Python would get ahead of Javascript.</p>
<p>However, to support <cite>async</cite> and <cite>await</cite> in the shell currently requires some
unsatisfying hacks. There are subtle issues with local versus global
variables, background tasks, and docstrings. Bussonnier has filed <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.python.org/issue34616">issue
34616, implement “Async exec”</a>, to make
full async support in the shell possible.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> After the Language Summit, Bussonnier and Yury Selivanov updated
the Python compiler to permit <cite>await</cite>, <cite>async for</cite>, and <cite>async with</cite> as top-
level syntax in the shell when executed like <cite>python -m asyncio</cite>:</p>

<p>A typical asyncio application has a single call to <cite>run_until_complete()</cite> near
the top level of the application, which runs the asyncio event loop for the
entire application. All code beneath this level must assume that the loop is
running.</p>
<p>Facebook engineer Jason Fried presented to the Language Summit a scenario in
which this application structure fails. Consider an async application that
contains a mix of async code and blocking calls that are tolerably fast. Deep
within the call stack of one of these blocking calls, a developer sees an
opportunity for concurrency, so she adds some async code and executes it with
<cite>run_until_complete()</cite>. This call raises “RuntimeError: This event loop is
already running.” As Fried explained, any call to <cite>run_until_complete()</cite> in a
call chain under async def has this result, but due to modularization and
unittest mocking in Facebook’s Python architecture, this error can first arise
late in the development cycle.</p>
<p>How should this problem be avoided? The asyncio philosophy is to avoid mixture
by converting all blocking code to asynchronous coroutines, but converting a
huge codebase all at once is intractable. “It’s a harder problem than moving
from Python 2 to 3,” he said, “because at least I can go gradually from Python
2 to 3.”</p>
<p>Fried suggested a solution for incrementally converting a large application,
and to allow developers to add asyncio calls anywhere “without fear.” He
proposed that the asyncio event loop allow recursive calls to
<cite>run_until_complete()</cite>. If the loop is already running, this call will
continue running existing tasks along with the new task passed in. Library
authors could freely use asyncio without caring whether their consumers also
use asyncio or not. “Yeah sure it’s ugly,” he conceded, “but it does allow you
to slowly asyncio-ify a distinct code base.”</p>
<p>Thomas Wouters objected that this proposal would violate many correctness
properties guaranteed by the current loop logic. Amber Brown concurred. She
explained that Twisted’s loop prohibits reentrance to ensure that timeouts
work correctly. One of the core tenets of asynchronous programming is that all
tasks must cooperate. There is no good solution, she said, for mixing blocking
and async code.</p>

<p>“Every few years someone comes along with some exciting new potential for
speeding up CPython,” began Mark Shannon, “and a year later everyone’s
forgotten about it.” Some of these optimizations are worth pursuing, however.
We can identify promising optimizations with a heuristic.</p>
<p>First, Shannon advised the audience to think in terms of time, not speed. Do
not measure the number of operations Python can execute in a period; instead,
measure the amount of time it requires to finish a whole task and divide the
total time into chunks. As an example, Shannon described a recent proposal on
the python-dev mailing list for implementing a register-based virtual machine,
which would store local variables in fixed slots, rather than on a stack as
the Python VM does today. How much time could such a change save? Shannon
walked the audience through his thought process, first estimating the cost of
the Python interpreter’s stack manipulation and guessing how much cheaper a
register-based VM would be. Shannon estimates that up to 50 percent of
Python’s runtime is “interpretive overhead,” and a register-based VM might
reduce that significantly, so it is worth trying. However, only an experiment
can measure the actual benefit.</p>
<p>Shannon compared the register-based VM to another optimization,
“superinstructions.” The technique is to find a common sequence of bytecodes,
such as the two bytecodes to load None onto the stack and then return it, and
combine them together into a new bytecode that executes the whole sequence.
Superinstructions reduce interpretive overhead by spending less time in the
main loop moving from one bytecode to the next. Shannon suspects this
technique would beat the register-based optimization.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Shannon advised the audience that the next time another
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3146/">Unladen Swallow</a> or similar
project appears, to determine first which part of the interpreter it
optimizes. If the optimization targets a part of the interpreter that
represents less than 90% of the total runtime, said Shannon, “it’s pretty much
doomed to fail.”</p>

<p>The past year has been marked by controversy in the Python community, but
consensus is forming on the most unexpected topic: code formatting. Łukasz
Langa’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/black/">Black</a> code formatter is only a
year old, but it has been adopted by pytest, attrs, tox, Django, Twisted, and
numerous other major Python projects. The core developers are enthusiastic
about Black, too: When Langa introduced himself as its author, the room broke
into applause.</p>
<p>Langa proposed moving black from his personal repository to the Python
organization on GitHub. He said, “My goal for this is to provide a suitable
default for users who don’t have any preexisting strong opinions on the
matter.”</p>
<p>Some core developers dissented, arguing that since Black is already so
successful, there is no need to move it. Gregory Smith said it is not the core
team’s role to bless one code formatter over others; he regrets that
opinionated tools like mypy are in the official organization and he opposes
adding more. Guido van Rossum suggested moving it to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PyCQA">Python Code Quality
Authority</a> organization; Langa responded that
beginners haven’t heard of that organization and moving Black there would have
no effect.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Despite some objections at the Language Summit, Black is now in
the official Python organization on GitHub.</p>
