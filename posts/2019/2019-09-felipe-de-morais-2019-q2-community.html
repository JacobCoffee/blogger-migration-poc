<h1>Felipe de Morais: 2019 Q2 Community Service Award Winner<a class="headerlink" href="#felipe-de-morais-2019-q2-community-service-award-winner" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/09/felipe-de-morais-2019-q2-community.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Pythonistas everywhere benefit when our community reflects the many
backgrounds and experiences of Python’s users. However it can be challenging
to participate in the community when there are no local user groups or harder
yet if groups do exist but you do not feel represented in them. After learning
that a friend was experiencing gender descrimination at work, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/felipedemorais_">Felipe de
Morais</a> of Porto Alegre, Brazil, decided
to start <a class="reference external" href="https://djangogirls.org/portoalegre/">Django Girls Porto Alegre</a>. By
starting this group, women like his friend who were facing similar challenges
could have a community to call their own.</p>
<p>Since Django Girls Porto Alegre took off in 2015, it has become one of the
most active Django Girls groups in the world. Inspired by Django Girls and
PyLadies, Felipe also started <a class="reference external" href="https://afropython.org/">AfroPython</a>, an
initiative to empower Black people through technology. Additionally, Felipe
contributes to <a class="reference external" href="https://serenata.ai/">Operação Serenata de Amor</a>, an open
source project that monitors public spending by politicians. For this work the
PSF is pleased to award Felipe de Morais with the Q2 2019 Community Service
Award:</p>
<p>&gt; <em>RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the Q2 2019 Community
&gt; Service Award to Felipe de Morais for his work towards facilitating the
&gt; growth of the Python Brazilian community by organizing workshops,
&gt; contributing to open source code that benefits the Brazilian people and for
&gt; setting an example for all community organizers.</em></p>
<p>Felipe grew up in Rio De Janeiro where he earned a graduate degree in Computer
Science and later moved to Porto Alegre in southern Brazil. With a strong
desire to be part of a community, Felipe traveled to IT-related Meetup groups
but longed for more accessible means to network and teach. Python was his go-
to language for its simplicity and ease, and he loved to teach the language to
help other people along in their careers. It is no surprise that the groups
he’s started have both a Python and inclusivity focus.</p>
<p>When asked about his motivation for starting Python groups, Felipe says that
that he simply gets great joy out of helping people. “I’ve seen people
starting their work life because the workshop unlocked this career path for
them,’’ he says. “The most important part of it is the relationships made
along the way, which make a great support system for a lot of people making
positive life changes.”</p>

<em>AfroPython 2017</em>
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/rsip22">Renata D’Avila</a>, a Django Girls Porto Alegre
organizer, met Felipe 2016 at a Hackerspace event and the two have kept in
touch ever since. “He is one of the people behind one of the biggest Django
Girls workshop ever organized.” she recalls, “Django Girls Porto Alegre 2017
had about 180 people involved, among participants, mentors, and organizers.”
However the event, as most events do, encountered some bumps in the road. As
lunchtime rolled around and the planned caterers never showed up, Felipe raced
across campus and resolved the issue, returning to the event with enough food
for everyone. “That was one of the greatest achievements of that huge
workshop,” says Renata, “that everyone could eat and that the schedule for the
workshop was kept without people even knowing about how much effort it took to
make it work.”</p>

<em>AfroPython 2018</em>
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/amandasv__">Amanda Vieira</a> met Felipe at Django Girls
Porto Alegre and later worked with him to create AfroPython. She says of his
work in these groups, “He has always helped both in the organization of events
and as a coach, encouraging more and more women to get started in the area [of
tech].” He has even developed a nickname, she quips “In his workplace and with
friends, he is known as Felipython for all his involvement with language and
the community.”</p>
<p>In May of 2017 when Felipe was attending <a class="reference external" href="https://2019.pythonsudeste.org/">Python
Sudeste</a>, a regional Python event in
southeastern Brazil, he met <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jesstemporal">Jessica
Temporal</a>. Jessica had been working as a
data scientist on a large political open-source project, Operação Serenata de
Amor. Serenata analyzes open data from the Brazilian government and flags
expenses made by elected politicians that might be unlawful. Jessica was
organizing a sprint at the conference and Felipe jumped in to help. In
addition to working on some important refactoring and code readability issues,
“Felipe was significant in making the project more friendly to newcomers,’’
she says. He continues to contribute to the project today.</p>

Though Django Girls Porto Alegre and AfroPython have taken off, Felipe has no
plans to slow down. In addition to continuing to work on open source projects,
he is on the organizing team for the first ever
<a class="reference external" href="http://afropythonconf.org/">AfroPythonConf</a> later this year, and will be a
keynote speaker at <a class="reference external" href="https://2019.pythonbrasil.org.br/">Python Brazil 2019</a>.</p>
