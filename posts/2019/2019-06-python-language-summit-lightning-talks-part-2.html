<p>The Summit concluded with a second round of lightning talks, which speakers
had signed up for that day. These talks were therefore more off-the-cuff than
the morning’s talks, and several of them were direct responses to earlier
presentations.</p>

<p>Python’s ssl module depends on OpenSSL. On Linux, Python uses the system
OpenSSL, but on Mac and Windows it ships its own. Christian Heimes explained
to the Language Summit that Python 3.7 must upgrade its included version of
OpenSSL to 1.1.1 to receive long-term support, but he warned that this change
might cause unexpected issues for Python programmers on Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Heimes wants to deprecate support for TLS 1.1 as soon as possible. Recent
Linux distributions and browsers already prohibit the old protocol for
security reasons. In Python 3.8 he plans to document that TLS 1.1 “may work”,
depending on the underlying OpenSSL version, and in Python 3.9 it will be
explicitly banned. Larry Hastings asked whether this change could be spread
over two Python releases, in the way that most features are first deprecated
and then removed. Heimes replied that OpenSSL itself is moving this quickly.</p>
<p>Python has poor support for the root certificate authority files included in
the operating system. On Linux and BSD, <cite>ssl.create_default_context()</cite> uses
the root CAs correctly. On Windows, according to Heimes, root CAs are partly
broken despite “a hack I added a couple years ago that does not work for
technical reasons.” And on macOS there is no support without installing the
<cite>certifi</cite> package. Heimes proposed to rely more on the operating system: on
Mac and Windows in particular, the interpreter should ask the OS to verify
certificates against its known CAs, instead of asking OpenSSL.</p>
<p>It has been several years since Heimes and Cory Benfield began drafting <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0543/">PEP
543</a>. This PEP would decouple
Python’s API from the specifics of the OpenSSL library, so it could use OS-
provided TLS libraries on macOS, Windows, and elsewhere. Heimes told the
Language Summit that he and Paul Kehrer would work on PEP 543 during the post-
PyCon sprints.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html">Argument Clinic</a> is a tool used
in the implementation of CPython to generate argument-parsing code for C
functions that are used from Python; i.e., “builtin” functions. (It is named
for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_Clinic">a Monty Python sketch</a>.)
Since its original intent was to create C functions that handle their
arguments like Python functions do, it only handles Python-like function
signatures.</p>
<p>Larry Hastings addressed the Language Summit to ask whether Argument Clinic
ought to be extended to handle argument parsing more generally, including
function signatures that would not be possible in pure Python. For example,
some builtin functions have parameters with a default value of NULL, which is
representable in C but not in Python. Hastings said he had observed developers
wanting to use Argument Clinic for all builtin functions because it is
convenient to use and generates fast code.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for CPython’s success is its powerful C API, which permits
C extensions to interact with the interpreter at a low level for the sake of
performance or flexibility. But, according to Eric Snow, the C API has become
a hindrance to progress because it is so tightly coupled to CPython’s
implementation details. He identified several problems with the current
CPython implementation, such as the GIL, but said, “we can’t go very far
fixing those problems without breaking the C API.”</p>
<p>One solution is to split the C API into four categories. The CPython header
files would be split into four directories to make it more obvious to core
developers and extension authors which category each type or function belongs
to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>“internal” — “Do not touch!”</p></li>
<li><p>“private” — “Use at your own risk!”</p></li>
<li><p>“unstable” — “Go for it (but rebuild your extension each Python release)!”</p></li>
<li><p>“stable” — “Worry-free!”</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are a number of other solutions proposed or in progress:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>It might be possible to <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/capi-sig&#64;python.org/thread/ZV3IQWW7XL6MHZAJARHW62WNZDCX3A4M/">use CFFI in place of the C API</a> to achieve a “better C API”, or <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/capi-sig&#64;python.org/thread/NSREULQDHSJ6SZTOY5YVSNX4U4AYJOI6/">to use Cython</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Victor Stinner has <a class="reference external" href="https://pythoncapi.readthedocs.io/roadmap.html">a longstanding project to improve the C API</a> by removing bad features and providing a second-generation API that is less coupled to CPython internals.</p></li>

<p>When a Windows user types <cite>python</cite> in the command shell on a clean system, the
shell typically responds, “python is not recognized as an internal or external
command”. After <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2019-May/157586.html">the May Windows update this will
change</a>:
Typing <cite>python</cite> in the shell will now open the Microsoft Store and offer to
install Python. When Steve Dower showed the install screen to the Language
Summit the audience broke into applause.
<em>screenshot</em></p>
<p>The package is owned by the Python core developers; Microsoft’s contribution
was to add the <cite>python</cite> command stub that opens the install page. Compared to
the installer that users can download from python.org, said Dower, “the
Microsoft Store is a more controlled environment.” Its distribution of Python
is easier to install and upgrade, at the cost of some inconsistencies with the
full Python install. “It’s not going to work for everyone.” Advanced
developers and those who want multiple versions of Python will prefer to
install it themselves, but the Microsoft Store will satisfy programmers who
simply need Python available. “Everyone with a Windows machine in any of the
tutorial rooms right now should probably be using this,” he said.</p>
<p>It had not been possible to install Python so conveniently on Windows, until
recent changes to the Microsoft Store. For example, Store apps were originally
prohibited from accessing their current working directory, but apps are now
permitted virtually the same permissions as regular programs.</p>
<p>Carol Willing asked whether the Store version of Python could be used for
reproducing data science results. “There are a number of situations where I
would say don’t use this package,” responded Dower. Since the Microsoft Store
will automatically update its version of Python whenever there is a new
release, data scientists who care about reproducibility should install Python
themselves.</p>

<p>In response to <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/pablo-galindo-salgado-nights-watch-is.html">Pablo Galindo Salgado’s earlier
talk</a> about the pain caused by test failures, Nathaniel Smith whipped up a
talk about the Rust language’s test system. The Rust community observes what
they call the <a class="reference external" href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html">Not Rocket Science
Rule</a>: “Automatically maintain a
repository of code that always passes all the tests.” Although it is obvious
that all projects ought to adhere to this rule, most fail to, including
Python. How does Rust achieve it?</p>
<p>When a Rust developer approves a pull request, the “bors” bot tests it and, if
the tests pass, merges the pull request to master.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZoZIvGnBDbS-Vlmo6Y5EIBrfa_n161oEbG2QuD0jcvds8vJObyvo5S84FQ5OGH-hxzy5Nf_SJPSh_1v0LhYoLzwq271WT_pS-WdfbHh7rqhhi92Ou6M483s8pbwUHUiFtEg/s640/Bors_-how-Rust-handles-buildbots-and-merge-workflow-1.png">![</a>](<a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZoZIvGnBDbS">https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiZoZIvGnBDbS</a>-

<p>This seems quite elementary, as Smith acknowledged. But there are two unusual
details of the bors system that enforce the Not Rocket Science Rule. The first
is that bors tests pull requests in strict sequence. It finds the next
approved pull request, merges it together with master, tests that version of
the code, and if the tests pass bors makes that version the new master,
otherwise it rejects the pull request. Then, bors moves to the next pull
request in the queue. Compared to the typical system of testing pull requests
_before_ merging, bors’s algorithm tests the version of the code that will
actually be published.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0cOpJN9F9w1YbJYEYHK_6dhzAo7vvBlGyjXnq0u5BCDHBtr1dHPO5DlLPFumDCoP3KblWdGDHXIt_KG0qCdWyVnq_yAV5-CscBD9VDjBQyps1RvvCHcENjv_9vzko2ZTAQg/s320/smith-1.jpg">![</a>](<a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0cOpJN9F9w1YbJYEYHK_6dhzAo7vvBlGyjXnq0u5BCDHBtr1dHPO5DlLPFumDCoP3KblWdGDHXIt_KG0qCdWyVnq_yAV5-CscBD9VDjBQyps1RvvCHcENjv_9vzko2ZTAQg/s1600/smith-1.jpg">https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0cOpJN9F9w1YbJYEYHK_6dhzAo7vvBlGyjXnq0u5BCDHBtr1dHPO5DlLPFumDCoP3KblWdGDHXIt_KG0qCdWyVnq_yAV5-CscBD9VDjBQyps1RvvCHcENjv_9vzko2ZTAQg/s1600/smith-1.jpg</a>)</p>
<p>The second way the Rust community enforces the Not Rocket Science Rule is by
requiring the bors process for all pull requests. “They do this for
everything,” said Smith. “This is how you merge. There’s no green button.”
Taken together, bors’s algorithm and the workflow requirement ensure that Rust
always passes its tests on master.</p>
<p>Smith described some conveniences that improve the Rust developer experience.
First, bors can be triggered on a pull request before approving it, as a spot
check to see whether the code passes the test suite as-is. Second, since bors
must test pull requests one at a time, it has an optimization to prevent it
from falling behind. It can jump ahead in the queue, merging a large batch of
pull requests together and testing the result. If they pass, they can all be
merged; otherwise, bors bisects the batch to find the faulty change, alerts
its author, and merges all the pull requests before it.</p>
<p>The Rust project currently uses a successor to bors called

<p>Python 3.8 will improve the long-term stability of the C API and ABI for
extension authors. Some of the details are settled, but Victor Stinner’s
presentation to the Language Summit showed there are still many unanswered
questions.</p>
<p>As Eric Snow had mentioned, C header files in Python 3.8 will be split into
directories for the public stable APIs, the unstable CPython-specific API, and
the internal API. Afterwards there will be less risk of exposing an internal
detail in the public API by mistake, since it will be obvious whenever a pull
request changes a public header.</p>
<p>CPython’s internal API headers were not installed by “make install” in the
past, but it could be useful for a debugger or other low-level tool to inspect
the interpreter’s internal data structures. Thus, in Python 3.8 the internal
headers will be installed in a special subdirectory.</p>
<p>In the course of Stinner’s regular work at RedHat he often debugs problems
with customers’ third-party C extension modules. A debug build of the
extension module might not be available, but Stinner could gather some useful
information by loading the extension module with a debug build of Python.
Today, this is impossible: debug builds of Python only work with debug builds
of extension modules and vice versa. <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.gt.net/python/dev/1418042">The debug build of Python 3.8, however,
will be ABI compatible with the release
build</a>, so the same extension modules
will work with both.</p>
<p>Another motivation for updating the C API is isolation of subinterperters.
Stinner referred to Petr Viktorin’s talk about removing process-wide global
state for the sake of proper isolation, and possibly giving each
subinterpreter its own GIL.</p>
<p>Attaining a clean, stable API and ABI may require breaking the current one;
the core developers’ discussion focused on how much to break backwards
compatibility and what techniques might minimize the impact on extension
authors. The shape of Python 3.8’s C API and ABI are not yet settled. When
Steve Dower asked whether Stinner was proposing a new stable ABI, Stinner
answered, “I’m not sure what I’m proposing.”</p>

<p>Tymciurak began his lightning talk by complimenting the Language Summit
participants. “In terms of communication skills, you do such a great job that
I’m shocked sometimes.”</p>
<p>The factors that contribute to collaboration, he said, begin with a diversity
of skills. <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/05/python-core-developer-mentorship.html">As Victor Stinner had mentioned in his mentorship
talk</a>, a team with mixed skill sets and skill levels has advantages
over a team of homogenous experts. Members of high-performing teams are also
enthusiastic about common goals, they are personally committed to their
teammates, and they show strong interpersonal skills.</p>
<p>Tymciurak credited Guido van Rossum for establishing the importance of
teamwork from the beginning. Nevertheless, he said, “sometimes things may go
off track.” The cause of irreconcilable disagreements or emotional blowups are
not always obvious, but Tymciurak claimed that to him, “it’s immediately
obvious and really simple to fix.”</p>
<p>Cognitive encapsulation is the awareness that one’s experience of reality is
not reality itself. “It’s your own mental model,” said Tymciurak. When we
communicate, if explicitly share with others what we think, see, or hear, then
we are respecting cognitive encapsulation. As Tymciurak describes it, “That’s
being aware that my thoughts are my own.” On the other hand, if we assume that
others already agree with us, or we represent our personal experience as if it
is the only possible experience for the whole group, then encapsulation is
violated and we are likely to cause conflict.</p>
<p>As an example of cognitive encapsulation at work, Tymciurak contrasted two
types of communication. One is transactional. Someone asks, “Where’s the
meeting?” You answer by saying which room it is in. Another type is control
communication. If an instructor commands students to “turn to page 47,” then
control communication is appropriate and the students will accept it. But when
a team member uses control communication without the team’s acceptance,
conflict arises. Tymciurak said, “When you tell someone else what to do,
you’re breaking the encapsulation. Be careful. There’s times when it’s
appropriate. But be aware of when it’s not.”</p>
<p>Another key practice that preserves cognitive encapsulation is to truly
listen. Especially when the speaker is a junior teammate, it is crucial to be
able to listen without agreeing, disagreeing, or correcting. Tymciurak
described the outcome of a team that works together this way. Individuals know
that they understand each others’ views, and they can advocate for their own
views, speaking from their own experience. “Then you can speak with authority
and power. And that’s part of the magic of encapsulation.”</p>
