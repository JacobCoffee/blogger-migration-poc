<h1>PyPI User Feedback Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#pypi-user-feedback-summary" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2021/12/pypi-user-feedback-summary.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The PSF conducted a series of three surveys to identify key user requirements
that have not been addressed so far. We used this round of surveys to engage
with the PyPI community and understand ways to support community needs better.
This post summarizes the feedback we have received and key decisions we have
made based on the feedback.</p>
<section id="purpose-of-the-surveys">
<h2>Purpose of the surveys<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose-of-the-surveys" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Identify one feature or group of features that would be most useful for users who are part of a corporate or community project</p></li>
<li><p>Identify features that can offered to companies on a subscription basis, and community projects at no cost</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>First Survey</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBMtuf6kIQo6OVPmKPgCA3MPFhtrX1UvqrlZA3fAvbvPU7Hg/viewform">first
survey</a>
was a general survey where PyPI users were invited to submit features they
would like PyPI to offer. This survey was targeted at users who used PyPI as a
team in their corporate or community project. We also asked permission from
survey respondents if we could contact them for more detailed feedback.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Most requested features from the first survey</p>
<p>![](<a class="reference external" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CcAu">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CcAu</a>-
YpBse_dEviBsOg_UTqjjdOEwiwIl2OVedhaeb8tzyqiPGAr7M9V4eisWj_tQeYrbw-3hrs9dUGFq_ffM1m9BaqfXViOfJ7NSioNEN7-uuOmBjem_vaXNY3qO_DRYJJzLxXx=w544-h304)</p>
<p>The first survey received 35 valid responses. Out of this, 12 responses were
for community projects. As seen in Figure 1, the most requested feature was
private packages. At second place, both organization accounts and namespace
support had the same number of requests. Other feature requests are listed
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GeG_dORA1j60PqRDO0AELLQIaoUuST9bITuYoX0yffU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Second Survey</p>
<p>Based on the feedback we received in the first survey, we invited respondents
for short interviews. 11 respondents agreed to meet us. At this interview, we
asked PyPI users to expand on previously shared feedback. We wanted to know
more about problems they faced when using PyPI as a team. We also wanted to
know how they used other package managers and which features were most useful
in these packaging managers. Of the 11 respondents, 5 respondents represented
community projects.</p>
<p>Figure 2: Most requested features in the second survey</p>
<p>![](<a class="reference external" href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/c3w3T1lTlOCsBKUTLhBBmC8YSBJXLBqRzTCcP8gl4fdhahh1vpy6YRWvq8GKR2a_XMeflcRMx0F-4ihXkN1-HaYPAzBjaad71-9sYg8Z-gYPrw7A580BgjLhCcOy4-vaTzSo2aIf=w538-h385">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/c3w3T1lTlOCsBKUTLhBBmC8YSBJXLBqRzTCcP8gl4fdhahh1vpy6YRWvq8GKR2a_XMeflcRMx0F-4ihXkN1-HaYPAzBjaad71-9sYg8Z-gYPrw7A580BgjLhCcOy4-vaTzSo2aIf=w538-h385</a>)</p>
<p>As seen in Figure 2, the most requested feature was organization accounts.
Other features such as namespace support and private packages were also
requested more than once. One common theme that emerged was how useful PyPI is
for many teams in different organizations and projects. Other packaging
managers such as npm and NuGet were also mentioned to indicate superior
features when it comes to managing multiple packages and teams, namespace
support and private packages. The minutes of the meetings are available
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVmVYMTIRK7ce4NlxlgzxOJtYu_FvmGq2wvfi-IfWHc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The minutes of one meeting cannot be shared publicly.</p>
<p>Third Survey</p>
<p>From the second survey, it was clear that features like organization accounts
and namespace support would be most useful to users in a team. This team could
represent an organization or community project. To confirm this finding, we
held another
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuDRH_KucxqHIYWVIMQJS_r6JFGMR0rNWn0KQ4bgMXsTlxhQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">poll</a>
asking users to choose between the three features- organization/team accounts,
namespace support and private packages.</p>
<p>Figure 3: Most requested features in the third survey</p>
<p>![](<a class="reference external" href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kTUQQluDaiJtm8YUauq3o-Gp75r2kVaHFPF05MZnihOiAUFpbzjR7-krGY9qQUzKybWNzjc_c91kFowkKiVr9WChThatqsYiEqXBf9FMbSHHpr">https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kTUQQluDaiJtm8YUauq3o-Gp75r2kVaHFPF05MZnihOiAUFpbzjR7-krGY9qQUzKybWNzjc_c91kFowkKiVr9WChThatqsYiEqXBf9FMbSHHpr</a>-
RNQfoc5Hzeq9fL_NLEehs8_RD=w545-h385)</p>
<p>There were 160 responses from the PyPI community. From Figure 3, it can be
seen that namespace support was the most requested feature with 64 requests.
There were 42 requests for organization accounts and 54 requests for private
packages. Other requested features are listed
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GeG_dORA1j60PqRDO0AELLQIaoUuST9bITuYoX0yffU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also asked users to share where they got to know about the poll. 81 users
saw the poll on Twitter. Another 27 users saw the poll on discuss.python.org
and 23 users found the poll in the PSF newsletter. A total of 29 users saw the
poll on other outlets such as PyCoder’s weekly, RealPython newsletter, company
Slack channel.</p>
<p>Key Decisions</p>
<p>From the three surveys, it was observed that organizations accounts, namespace
support and private packages were the three most important features for users.
There were multiple requests for these three features. Based on the feedback
we have received so far, we have made these key decisions-</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The PSF will develop organization accounts in the first phase of development. Any feature targeted at organization or community projects will require organization accounts to manage the feature. Hence, it makes sense to develop organization accounts first. This feature will allow organizations to manage multiple users and multiple packages.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations accounts will be offered on a subscription basis. Private organizations will be charged a fixed amount while community projects will avail this feature free of cost.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Next Steps</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Develop the project roadmap for organization account feature. This roadmap will be shared with the community once the Packaging Working Group reviews and approves it.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and share RfP for organization account feature on PyPI. We will invite developers to build this feature on a contract basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Work with the PyPI community to scope out the namespace support feature. We will invite users to share their feedback to define the requirements, functionalities and behaviour. Once the organization account feature has been developed and delivered, we will develop the namespace support feature.</p></li>
<li><p>Engage with the PyPI community to identify more features that can be offered to organizations and community projects.</p></li>
</ul>
