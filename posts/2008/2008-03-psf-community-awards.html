<h1>PSF  Community Awards<a class="headerlink" href="#psf-community-awards" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2008/03/psf-community-awards.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>A little-publicized feature of this year’s PyCon was the first ever PSF
Community Awards. One of the issues with being a Foundation of part-timers is
that sometimes we do something important without finding a way to give it the
right prominence. If I were able to borrow <a class="reference external" href="http://devpit.org/jargon/html/G/Guido.html">Guido’s time
machine</a> and go round PyCon again
these awards would have been made in front of the first keynote speech.</p>
<p>Even the recipients of the awards were blissfully unaware of their elevated
status until our outgoing Chairman, Stephan Deibel, informed them by email. So
let me list these unsung heroes (in alphabetical order). If you have benefited
by their work it would be nice if you could find time to add a (short) comment
to this post to let them know how much their hard work is appreciated.</p>
<p><em>Matthew Dixon Cowles</em> Matthew has been a tireless (and unfailingly polite)
responder to the many users of _python-<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">help_</span></a> list, used by those seeking
assistance not readily available through other channels. This assistance
covers not only elementary questions but also quite advanced ones. Matthew has
been a member of the Python community for many years, patiently answering
questions and enlightening those who seek to get more out of the Python
language.</p>
<p><em>Brad Knowles</em> Brad has managed the _python.org_ e-mail since I can
remember, and it’s down to him that our lists and newsgroups are so blissfully
free of spam. It’s hard to appreciate the sheer volume of mail that Brad
handles, and he is fiercely defensive of our domain’s status on the Internet.
Keeping the e-mail flowing is essential not just to the PSF but also to all
the users of mailing lists and newsgroups. Brad does all this not because he
is a big Python user, but because it _needs to be <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">done_</span></a>. This is the community
service ethic at its best.</p>
<p><em>Peter Kropf</em> and <em>Martin Thomas</em> Peter and Martin are probably best known
to those people who want to employ Python programmers, as they have jointly
been almost the sole workforce behind the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/community/jobs/">Python Job
Board</a> for the last several years. The
fact that the Job Board exists, and is available free of charge to anyone
looking to hire people with Python skills, is possibly more central to
Python’s rise in popularity than we appreciate. PyCon chairman David Goodger
paid tribute to the Job Board as helping him out of unemployment in his
opening remarks this year, and I know there are dozens if not hundreds of
others who should be similarly grateful to Peter and Martin.</p>
<p>We should also not overlook those who answer the elementary questions we get
on the _python-<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">tutor_</span></a> mailing list. The list is often overlooked by the more
advanced Python users, but this is where anyone can come and get their first
questions about Python answered (and often learn programming along the way).
The friendly courtesy they meet there sets the tone for future Python
community interactions, which may be one reason why _comp.lang.python_ has
such a reputation for courtesy. Apologies to the _python-<a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">tutor_</span></a> list members
for an earlier mistaken attribution of Matthew’s affiliation.</p>
<p>The PSF Board has been discussing (and, when I dropped the ball, failing to
discuss) an awards scheme for some time now, and these first four awards
represent the beginnings of a way to regularly offer some recognition to
people who tirelessly support Python and its community year in year out. They
will not just be made at PyCon but at intervals throughout the year, and
future nominations will come from the membership at large.</p>
<p>The award comes in the form of a free registration to a future PyCon, $500
towards conference expenses, and a handsome (but yet-to-be designed)
certificate. Thanks for all your hard work on behalf of the whole Python
community, guys! One of the benefits of the awards is that now I _know_ I’ll
be able to see you all at PyCon next year!</p>
