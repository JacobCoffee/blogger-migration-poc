<h1>Virtual Python Core Developer Sprint 2020<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-python-core-developer-sprint-2020" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/12/virtual-python-core-developer-sprint.html">here</a>.</p>
<section id="overview">
<h2><em>Overview</em><a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>From October 19th to 23rd, 47 participants gathered for the first-ever virtual
2020 Python Core Developer Sprint. This included 41 Python core developers, 3
triagers, and 3 core dev mentees. The core dev sprint is an annual week-long
meeting in which the CPython core team has the opportunity to work directly
together on projects and get to know one another better, free from outside
distractions. Many of the core developers participating in the event received
the week off from their employer to focus on the sprint.</p>
<p>Due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the event had to be done
remotely. This was unlike previous years, where it was hosted in-person by a
sponsoring organization. While it was not exactly the same experience, it came
with the silver lining of allowing participants to join the sprint from
anywhere in the entire world, including those that would have otherwise been
unable to travel to a physical event. Participants joined in from Canada, USA,
England, Poland, Israel, China, Germany, South Korea, Japan, and the
Netherlands.</p>
<p>Google stepped up to host the in-person event in 2020. Since that didn’t work
out, they were able to sponsor the virtual event so participants could receive
a meal stipend for the entire week. We hope the availability of that stipend
made it a more enjoyable event for participants.</p>

<h2>Setting<a class="headerlink" href="#setting" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The virtual event itself was hosted on <a class="reference external" href="https://pythondiscord.com/">Python
Discord</a>, one of the largest and most active
dedicated Python communities with over 100k members. Hosting the event on an
existing Discord server allowed us to significantly simplify the setup
process, obtain invaluable help from the Python Discord admin team, and create
a greater audience pool for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXMdfBTcOfQ">community
Q&amp;A</a>. The platform choice was
reached democratically through <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/2020-core-dev-sprint-poll-discord-or-zulip/5016?u=aeros">a
poll</a> in the “Committers” section of
<a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/">discuss.python.org</a>.</p>
<p>Leading up to the sprint, we created a <a class="reference external" href="https://python-core-sprint-2020.readthedocs.io/">readthedocs site</a> as a centralized location for documentation on
the sprint, links to shared docs, google calendar, project participants,
Discord setup, and more. There was also a dedicated “Tech Check” day, where we
set aside a full day to answer participant questions about the sprint and help
them with any platform setup. Other components involved in organization of the
sprint were tracked via the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python/core-sprint">python/core-sprint
repo</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="statistics">
<h2>Statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#statistics" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>By the end of the sprint, we merged a total of 215 pull requests within the
core Python repositories, including CPython, devguide, peps, etc. On Discord,
sprint participants posted more than 5,800 messages across various channels.</p>
<p>The Ask a Core Dev Anything session was hosted by the Python Discord admin
team and live-streamed to YouTube. It had 2,100 unique live viewers, and
peaked at 385 concurrent viewers. By the end of the sprint, the session had
3,339 total viewers, with 37 countries tuned in. After the session, a number
of core developers continued engaging with Python community members on Discord
in the #stream-afterparty channel.</p>

<section id="project-highlights">
<h2>Project Highlights<a class="headerlink" href="#project-highlights" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each individual project effectively had their own sub-group, and organized
internal meetings via a shared Google Calendar. Some of these projects
included stdlib modules such as asyncio, importlib, pegen, ast; as well as
other areas like C-API/subinterpreters, PR review, pattern matching, PEP 594
and improving new contributor experience. Here were some of the highlights for
each project:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>documentation</em> - Completed a Documentation Workgroup Charter to be approved by the Steering Council, which would effectively act as a committee of active documentation contributors to create goals for large projects, work through pending documentation PRs, and vote on general documentation decisions (such as the purpose and direction of the tutorial).</p></li>
<li><p><em>asyncio</em> - Initially started with a focus on a new streaming API, but was redirected to mapping out the blueprints for an upcoming exception group PEP, which would allow multiple exceptions to be simultaneously propagated for better exception handling in concurrent programs. This is intended to eventually lead to task groups in asyncio.</p></li>
<li><p><em>importlib</em> - Worked on support for namespace packages, which was a longstanding issue. Also worked through 3.10 blocker around unreleased zip file handles.</p></li>
<li><p><em>pegen</em> - Discussions around steps moving forward with migrations to the new parser. This included publishing a PyPI package with the new parser for 3rd party packages to utilize, merging a PR to make the parser faster, and porting f-strings.</p></li>
<li><p><em>C-API/subinterpreters</em> - Created a PR for finishing remaining parts of PEP 573, gathering ideas for improving stable ABI, isolation of extension modules, progress towards isolating runtime state to being per-interpreter, and work on runtime finalization code.</p></li>
<li><p><em>garbage collection</em> - Discussions around prototyping a tracing garbage collector with the constraints of maximizing backwards-compatibility with existing C extensions.</p></li>
<li><p><em>pattern matching</em> - Completed drafts for PEPs 634, 635, and 636, sent to SC, and opened a draft PR for the reference implementation of those PEPs.</p></li>
<li><p><em>core mentorship/new contributors</em> - Discussions around automated welcome and first PR merged messages, incentivising contributors with 2 other reviews for one review of their own PR, automated reminders for stalled PRs, revitalization of core dev office hours, increasing core dev mentorship with documented guides.</p></li>
<li><p><em>PEP 594</em> - Discussions around moving forward with the PEP, archiving removed modules, adoption of modules from 3rd parties, and making the transition smoother for the few users who still rely on them.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="promotions-and-mentorships">
<h2>Promotions and Mentorships<a class="headerlink" href="#promotions-and-mentorships" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The team gained two new Python triage members during the sprint: Irit Katriel
and Andre Delfino. Irit has been actively contributing to CPython for the past
several months. Andre has been contributing to CPython for more than two
years, and already had the bug triage permission on b.p.o.</p>
<p>One of the mentees who participated in the sprint, Hai Shi (mentored by Victor
Stinner), was later granted the bug triage privileges a month after the
sprint. Batuhan Taşkaya, who was one of the bug triage members participating
in the sprint, was promoted to core developer a few weeks after the sprint.</p>
<p>Other mentees participating were Lewis Gaul and Filipe Laíns. Lewis was being
mentored by Eric Snow to work on subinterpreters, and Filipe was being
mentored by Jason R. Coombs to work on importlib.resources.</p>

<section id="retrospective">
<h2>Retrospective<a class="headerlink" href="#retrospective" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to improve future sprints (especially any with a virtual component),
we also asked participants at the end of the event to fill out a survey to
provide feedback on parts of the sprint for parts they enjoyed and areas of
improvement.</p>
<p>Enjoyed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Usage of Discord as a platform</p></li>
<li><p>Unscheduled voice/video chats</p></li>
<li><p>Social games (such as the escape room event)</p></li>
<li><p>Having an agenda for large meetings</p></li>
<li><p>The Kick-off meeting</p></li>
<li><p>Dedicated off-topic channels</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>For each project, having one person as the assigned leader to schedule meetings, create an agenda, and provide a summary of accomplishments</p></li>
<li><p>Using a shared cloud/google drive folder instead of sharing individual documents</p></li>
<li><p>More automation for joining the Discord server and assigning roles</p></li>
<li><p>Dedicated separate server going forward to help with overload of unread channels</p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining a single centralized dashboard. Our <a class="reference external" href="https://python-core-sprint-2020.readthedocs.io/">readthedocs site</a> initially started that way, but could have used more periodic updates</p></li>
<li><p>Swag/merchandise for the event (did not have adequate time this year)</p></li>
