<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/pydebb">Débora Azevedo</a> co-founder of PyLadies Brazil and
Django Girls Natal organizer, has been awarded the Python Software Foundation
Q4 2019 Community Service Award.</p>
<p>Débora’s outstanding contributions to the growth and support of the Python
community goes well beyond PyLadies Brazil and Django Girls Natal - as she is
actively involved in Python translation work.</p>
<p>In 2018, she translated the Python Software Foundation
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/">survey</a>
into Potuguese.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons, that the Python Software Foundation is pleased to
present Débora with the 2019 Q4 Community Service Award:</p>
<p>&gt; <em>RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the 2019 Q4 Community
&gt; Service Award to Débora Azevedo in recognition of her work in supporting the
&gt; wider Python community in Brazil and the PSF generally. She’s a co-founder
&gt; of PyLadies Brazil, leader and organizer for Django Girls Natal, and helped
&gt; found amd organizes the PyLadies Brazil conference. Débora’s also been
&gt; interested in supporting the wider community. Last year, Débora assisted the
&gt; PSF by translating a survey into Portuguese. Additionally, she is a regular
&gt; presenter and attends many community events.</em></p>

<h2>Debora’s Introduction to Programming - The Origin Story<a class="headerlink" href="#debora-s-introduction-to-programming-the-origin-story" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Débora’s first introduction to programming was in 2008, as part of an IT
technical course. But, it was an upleasant experience, she recalls. Being both
young and without access to a computer, her first introduction to programming
made the concept unclear and hard to grasp.</p>
<p>Years later, Débora enrolled into a Computer Networks course - so she would
not have to code. Unknown to her, the course required her to take three
programming classes, all taught in Python. This was a turning poing in her
coding journey - as she realised how empowering being able to code could be.
One of those moments came when she had to develop a web app using Django for
the school library.</p>
<p>From then on, Débora was hooked.</p>

<h2>Involvement in the Developer Community - Co-founding PyLadies Brazil<a class="headerlink" href="#involvement-in-the-developer-community-co-founding-pyladies-brazil" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suprised at the low turnout of female attendees and sometimes, the complete
absence of women at local open source community meetups hosted by
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.potilivre.org/">Potilivre</a>, Débora, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/_gabiCavalcante">Gabriela
Calvalcante</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/_claranobre">Clara
Nobre</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/amelie_kn">Katyanna
Moura</a>, started the <a class="reference external" href="https://pyladiesnatal.github.io/">PyLadies
Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>They were spurred on by a feeling of belonging, having their technical skills
validated, their voices heard and a general desire of building a community of
women with the same interest.</p>
<p>Débora took on more responsibility and became a co-founder for the PyLadies
Brazil.</p>
<p>On the topic of Women in Tech, Débora believes that one of the most important
things Women in Tech can do for other women is for them to step up as role
models.</p>
<p>&gt; “_Being able to tend to other ladies, in an industry, where some women
&gt; consider themselves unfit, is <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">revolutionary_</span></a> “ says Débora.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/sergiomarioq">Mario Sergio</a>, program manager at Open
Knowledge Brazil and past president of Associação Python Brazil, who first met
Débora in 2014 at the Python Brazil conference in Porto de Galinhas,
Permnambuco, speaks on Débora’s contributions towards increasing women
participation and increasing overall diversity in the Python Brazil community.</p>
<p>&gt; “_The Python and Django Girls tutorials that Débora organized together with
&gt; others, were essential for the inclusion of women. The`Python Brazil
&gt; Conference &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://brasil.pyladies.com/">https://brasil.pyladies.com/</a>&gt;`_ has had an almost fifty percentage
&gt; female speakers in the last four <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">editions_</span></a>” -  <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/sergiomarioq">Mario
&gt; Sergio</a></p>
<p>On Débora, being a teacher and a mentor?</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/_claranobre">Clara Nobre</a>, says Débora drives and
inspires ladies in her local community to embrace programming. And to pursue a
career in tech. These ladies, whom Débora inspires, had before now, been
largely undecided in what career they wanted to pursue.</p>
<p>&gt; “_Débora is one of the main references in the communtiy to other women. She
&gt; is also a woman with a background in another area of expertise, which is
&gt; English Letters. Débora is a teacher! So she can reach so many girls who
&gt; still don’t know what career they intend to pursue, as well as women who are
&gt; in the area of Information Technology but haven’t yet developed the maturity
&gt; to <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">program_</span></a> “ - <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/_claranobre">Clara Nobre</a></p>

<h2>Crowdfunding Campaigns - Sponsoring Women to Attend Python Brazil<a class="headerlink" href="#crowdfunding-campaigns-sponsoring-women-to-attend-python-brazil" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Conference</p>
<p>In 2016, Débora and the team launched their first crowdfunding campaign to
help raise funds to take some women of the PyLadies Brazil to Python Brazil,
the largest Python conference in Latin America.</p>
<p>They raised R$5,975 (USD1,190), which was used to sponsor women to the 2016
Python Brazil conference.</p>
<p>In 2017, Débora and the team, again raised R$15,842 (USD3,160), sponsoring
fourteen women who had requested for financial aid to participate in the 2017
edition of the Python Brazil conference. This resulted in a peak of forty two
percent participation and activities led by PyLadies at the conference.</p>
<p>&gt; “_In 2018,   we had a total of 26 talks and tutorials, which were given by
&gt; women. Some of these activities were only possible, thanks to our
&gt; crowdfunding campaigns, which raised R$11,770 (USD2,347), making
&gt; participation in a conference like Python Brazil possible for nine <a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">women_</span></a>” -

<p>themselves</p>
<p>On why she contributes so much to the Python Community?</p>
<p>Débora says</p>
<p>&gt; _”Together with the PyLadies, the wider Python community can collaborate,
&gt; working as partners with one goal in common. Having women become active
&gt; participants and leaders in the Python community is important. It shouldn’t
&gt; be just one group’s fight. By joining forces we can go a lot further. Being
&gt; part of PyLadies Brazil and Django Girls Natal is the way I found to do my
&gt; little good in the IT world. Teaching, advising and helping more women to
&gt; believe in themselves and feel like it is possible for them and to feel like
&gt; they can do it.”_</p>
