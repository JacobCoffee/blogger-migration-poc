<h1>Rami Chowdhury Awarded the PSF Community Service Award for Q3 2020<a class="headerlink" href="#rami-chowdhury-awarded-the-psf-community-service-award-for-q3-2020" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2020/11/rami-chowdhury-awarded-psf-community.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://necaris.net/about/">Rami Chowdhury</a> Entrepreneur, Software Engineer,
DC Python User group co-organizer, and volunteer coordinator of PyCon US, has
been awarded the Python Software Foundation 2020 Q3 Community Service Award.</p>
<p>&gt; RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the 2020 Q3 Community
&gt; Service Award to Rami Chowdhury for his community work. Rami helps organize
&gt; and contribute to the DC Python user group. For many years Rami has been a
&gt; volunteer coordinator and incident responder at PyCon US. Most recently Rami
&gt; has been a helpful member of the PSF Code of Conduct WG.</p>
<p>We interviewed Rami to shed more light on his work in the Python community. We
also asked several of Rami’s close associates - including Ewa Jodlowska,
Jackie Augustine, Kenneth Durril, and Alex Clark - who have had the
opportunity of working with Rami during DC Python and PyCon US.</p>
<section id="rami-chowdhury-s-origin-story">
<h2>Rami Chowdhury’s Origin Story<a class="headerlink" href="#rami-chowdhury-s-origin-story" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Can you tell us about your origin story?</em></p>
<p>I had an eclectic and broad-minded group of friends at university who
encouragred me in ever-more-complex experiments with my personal computer,
despite that not being my subject of study.</p>
<p>With their help and encouragement, I progress through installing Linux-based
operating system, learning the command line, and finally getting into the
world of programming as a hobby.</p>
<p>Later,  while working in an internship, I found an opportunity to apply my
hobby skills in an actual paid job - and jumped in with both feet!</p>
<p><em>What was your earliest involvement with the Python community?</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I went to my first PyCon well before I made a living in software - I had
learned the programming language and really enjoyed it, and hoped I’d be able
to make a good impression at the job fair and get to use Python at work.</p>
<p>So my first time volunteering was when I was just wandering cluelessly around
the convention hotel, heard someone loudly ask for help taping down electrical
wiring and thinking - sure, I can do that!</p>
<p>I found helping out so invigoratng that I looked for more chances to help here
and there, and met amazing people volunteering, and one thing led to another
and all of a sudden I was on a committee feeling like I could give a little
something back to the open-source community.</p>
<p>By the time I moved to DC, I’d been volunteering in my local Python community
for a while, and so when I saw requests for help leading a study group at the
library I was confident enough to enthusiastically rasie my hand.</p>
<p>Thanks to the friendliness of the DC Python organizers I soon found myself one
of them, and helping to put together all kinds of events.</p>

<p><em>You have been a volunteer coordinator and incident responder at PyCon US for

What drives and inspires you into volunteering your time and resources into
the Python Community?</em></p>

</ul>
<p>When I was young and looking to get better at something - I specifically
remember having this conversation when my father was trying to teach me to
play chess - my parents told me to always seeks out and try to play with
someone who’s better than me, so I can learn from them and improve.</p>
<p>It turns out the same thing applies in my adult life - if I try to surround
myself with the best people I know, I’ll always learn and improve and become a
better person.</p>
<p>In both personal and professional contexts, some of the most intelligent,
empathetic, thoughtful and inspirational people I’ve met have been through the
Python community, and I keep volunteering so I can learn from their example.</p>

</ul>
<p>It’s pretty safe to say I wouldn’t have the career I do if it were not for the
Python community. Having honest and open conversations at my local meetup got
me my first offer of a job as a developer, and the strengths and values of the
community have continued to shape my career since then.</p>
<p>I’m currently working to embody those values at <a class="reference external" href="https://coiled.io">Coiled</a> -
where we’re building tools to empower Python users to work with data at any
scale they need - and I hope I’ll be lucky enough to continue to build a
career in and around this amazing community.</p>

<h2>Rami Chowdhury’s Impact Story on the Python and PyCon community<a class="headerlink" href="#rami-chowdhury-s-impact-story-on-the-python-and-pycon-community" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ewa Jodlowska, Executive Director, Python Software Foundation speaks on Rami’s
contributions to the PyCon US and impact on the Python community:</p>
<p>&gt; Rami impacted PyCon US several ways as a volunteer. For over 10 years, Rami
&gt; has been a part of PyCon in one capacity or another. Rami has helped
&gt; hundreds of international attendees obtain invitation letters, he has helped
&gt; organize PyCon Sprints, volunteers, and also has been an incident responder
&gt; for our code of conduct team. It is safe to say that Rami has impacted
&gt; thousands of attendees and we are super lucky to have Rami as part of our
&gt; community.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Rami impacts so many different aspects of our community. Even though I first
&gt; met Rami at PyCon US a decade ago, in the most recent years, I learned Rami
&gt; does so much more than help with PyCon. A couple years back, Rami got
&gt; involved with the PSF’s code of conduct work group and has been a consistent
&gt; helper with documentation. Additionally, Rami helps organize his local
&gt; Python user group, PyDistrict for several years now.</p>
<p>Jackie Augustine, Event Manager, Python Software Foundation shares Rami’s
impact as a volunteer coordinator for PyCon US:</p>
<p>&gt; Rami has worked for many years as the Volunteer Coordinator for PyCon US.
&gt; His work was essential for the launch of the volunteer sign up process and
&gt; the management of the volunteers onsite at each conference. If there was an
&gt; empty position that needed to be filled, Rami would work diligently to find
&gt; a volunteer to fill it or he would step in himself to do the work needed.
&gt; Rami has a way of working with the volunteers to make them feel appreciated
&gt; for the work they are doing and to have fun while doing so.</p>
<p>Kenneth Durill, volunteer co-chair of the PyCon US, gives credence to Jackie’s
comments on Rami’s volunteering efforts:</p>
<p>&gt; Rami is a volunteer that operates like a paid employee. He does it because
&gt; he cares and he clearly has fun. His passion is inspiring.</p>
<p>Alex Clark, President and Executive Director of DC Python, shares more on
Rami’s impact and contributions to the DC Python community:</p>
<p>&gt; In 2014, I had been hosting monthly in-person events for about 10 years and
&gt; was ready for a break. But I didn’t want to step away completely; I wanted
&gt; to hang around to make sure events kept happening.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Rami was critical to the success of DC Python during this time.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; It’s one thing to attend a meeting or two to learn some Python, and those
&gt; kinds of folks are our target audience. They help us to fulfill our mission
&gt; as a “Scientific and educational 501(c)(3) organization in Maryland
&gt; supporting the Python Software developer community in DC and worldwide.”
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But we can’t do it alone. So it’s quite another thing when someone attends
&gt; meeting after meeting, not only for their own benefit, but to serve others.
&gt; As Organizer, I get to see the rare occassions when volunteers “bubble up to
&gt; the top” and it’s quite a thrill and honor to me to do so. Not to mention
&gt; the countless folks Rami has taught Python to over the years at our events.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I appreciate reliability and consistency in others, particularly when it
&gt; comes to important endeavours like helping other people be better versions
&gt; of themselves. When COVID hit, our in-person events were cancelled, and our
&gt; online events have been limited. When nothing else was happening and I
&gt; wanted to make something happen, I scheduled a “live stream” and Rami was
&gt; one of 15 in attendance. He showed up and continues to show up for DC
&gt; Python. You can’t put a price on that type of dedication to a cause, it
&gt; comes from deep inside a person, and we’re very lucky to have Rami in our
&gt; community.</p>

<h2>Cheers to the ever smiling Rami<a class="headerlink" href="#cheers-to-the-ever-smiling-rami" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Python Software Foundation congratulates and celebrates Rami, and we wrap
this with a side note from Ewa Jodlowska:</p>
<p>&gt; I have never seen Rami _not_ smiling. Rami is a caring and empathetic person
&gt; and he brings that into everything he does for our community. I am happy we
&gt; get to celebrate his contributions with a Community Service award. It is
&gt; very much deserved!</p>
