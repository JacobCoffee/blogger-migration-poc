<h1>python.org is getting a makeover!<a class="headerlink" href="#python-org-is-getting-a-makeover" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/11/pythonorg-is-getting-makeover.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is with great pride that on behalf of the Python Software Foundation and
the community as a whole, I am pleased to announce that the official
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python.org</a> website, sub-sites, and back-end
architecture are getting a total makeover.</p>
<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Python has grown significantly in the last few years, both in terms of
audience and the amount of topical information about it. This abundance of
information has outgrown the current website’s taxonomy and fundamental
design.</p>
<p>The key goal of the redesign project is to update Python’s official web
presence with an eye towards better organizing the information we have today,
and expect to add in the future.</p>
<p>The end result aims to help our audience find the information they need
whether it’s official information like downloads and documentation, or
resources from our vibrant community.</p>
<p>Although the current implementation of the Python website has served its
purpose over the years, the time has come for the site to progress and
complement the growth and maturity of the language itself as well as the
vibrancy of the community.</p>
</section>
<section id="theres-a-lot-we-want-to-achieve">
<h2>There’s a lot we want to achieve<a class="headerlink" href="#theres-a-lot-we-want-to-achieve" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Modern design and experience</p></li>
<li><p>Concise and intuitive navigation</p></li>
<li><p>Showcase the simplicity and elegance of the language</p></li>
<li><p>Attract and convert potential Python users and Python Software Foundation sponsors</p></li>
<li><p>Represent our vibrant, active community</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easy for a wide range of contributors to add content</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance the visibility of the PSF and its sponsors</p></li>
<li><p>Provide examples of success stories</p></li>
<li><p>Enhance the visibility of alternate implementations</p></li>
<li><p>Stable and scalable infrastructure</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The redesign involves some tall tasks. From the fresh and modern UI/UX to the
online <em>and</em> offline content editing features, no aspect of the project is
to be taken lightly, or even incrementally. Such approaches have stalled and
ultimately failed in the past, and rapidly outstrip the free time our
community of volunteers can dedicate to the project.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-process">
<h2>The Process<a class="headerlink" href="#the-process" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a process that started <em>over</em> two years ago with the drafting of the
of the Request For Proposals. <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonorg-redesign.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">This year we issued it
publicly</a>, and since
that time the psf-redesign team grew to include Nick Coghlan, Doug Hellmann,
Idan Gazit, Steve Holden, Brian Curtin, Andrew Kuchling, Issac Kelly, Katie
Cunningham, Noah Kantrowitz and others.</p>
<p>The team received seven bids in total - all of them which included strong
points and compelling stories. The team deliberated, ranked, discussed, and
asked questions of the bidders, working through the bids for several months.
We were constantly impressed by the high quality, well thought out,
professional work that the community members submitted to us.</p>
<p>After the review period came to a close, we had a single bid which ranked
higher than any of the others, based on experience, references, and overall
quality of the proposal. They’ll be working with the second highest rated bid,
which contained UI/UX and IA that absolutely floored the reviewers.</p>
<p>The first bid, submitted by a joint effort between <a class="reference external" href="http://www.projectevolution.com/">Project
Evolution</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.revsys.com/">Revolution
Systems</a>, was the overall highest ranked bid. The team
was unanimous in our recommendation to proceed forward with this bid based on
the credentials of the team, quality of the proposal, and their deep
understanding of how to work with volunteer organizations, oversight and the
community as a whole.</p>
<p>This bid provides a clear project management and accountability system as well
as detailing how they wish to work with the community as a whole to achieve
the project goals.</p>
<p>Second, we had the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.divio.ch/">Divio.ch</a> team bid. The IA/UX/UI
work which they poured over 120 hours into as a company impressed us a great
deal. We were quite literally floored by the amount of thought, planning, and
work invested in the visual and IA aspects of the Divio bid.</p>
<p>Together with Project Evolution and Revolution Systems leading the project,
and the stellar Divio team consulting on the visual/IA aspects of the project,
the redesign team and the board is sure that we will be able to deliver a next
generation experience. The architecture being developed will achieve all of
the goals we set forth when we went down the path of drafting the redesign
RFP.</p>
<p>On September 26th, the Python Software Foundation’s board of directors
unanimously approved the combined bids:</p>
<p>&gt; RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation accept the Python.org site
&gt; redesign proposal set forth by Project Evolution / Revolution Systems and
&gt; Divio with a budget not to exceed $70,000 in total without further board
&gt; approval.</p>

<section id="overview-of-the-accepted-bids">
<h2>Overview of the Accepted Bids<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-accepted-bids" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The redesign project will completed by the three teams, Project Evolution,
RevSys, and Divio, with a division of labor using the best aspects of each
team. The project plan and the back end will be handled by members of Project
Evolution and RevSys. Members of Project Evolution will handle the front end
work, incorporating the guidance of the Divio team.</p>

<section id="id2">
<h3>Revolution Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Revolution Systems, LLC., based in Lawrence, Kansas, was formed in 2002 by
Frank Wiles to help businesses benefit from open source software. While many
large organizations use open source software internally (sometimes without
their knowledge), he realized that many organizations did not know how to
properly take advantage of this revolutionary type of software.</p>

<section id="divio">
<h3>Divio<a class="headerlink" href="#divio" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Divio, a web agency located in Zürich, Switzerland, builds web applications
and is specialised in the areas of design and development. For production,
Divio uses the Django web framework and is heavily involved in the development
of the successful open source projects django CMS and django SHOP.</p>

<h2>In Closing<a class="headerlink" href="#in-closing" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am sincerely proud, as both a Python community member and PSF director, to
have been part of this process. The entire review team, every single submitted
bid, and the Foundation’s board works tirelessly for a great deal of time
pulling together what is already turning out to be an impressive and
surprising redesign.</p>
<p>The design will work on mobile devices. It will follow all of the guidelines
of the RFP, support accessibility requirements, and much much more.
Most of all, it will showcase our language and global community like it has
never has been before.</p>
