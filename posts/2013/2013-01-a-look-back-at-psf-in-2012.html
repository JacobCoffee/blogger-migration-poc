<h1>A Look Back at the PSF in 2012<a class="headerlink" href="#a-look-back-at-the-psf-in-2012" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-look-back-at-psf-in-2012.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>2012 year was a good year for Python, and it was especially good for the
Python Software Foundation. Here’s a look back at some of the highlights of
the foundation’s actions in 2012. As always, you can find out about the
resolutions that the board has passed at`
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/">http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/</a> &lt;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/">http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/resolutions/</a>&gt;`_
and each meeting of the board of directors has minutes posted at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/">http://www.python.org/psf/records/board/minutes/</a>.
*</p>
<p><em>Conference Sponsorship</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The foundation sponsored 18 conferences in 15 countries for a total of USD
$32,661.53. Among those funded were a group of established conferences, and
something we’re always happy to find out about: new conferences. The inaugural
PyCarolinas, and PyCons in South Africa, Philippines, and Canada were
newcomers to the conference scene, along with RuPy Brazil starting a new
branch of the RuPy brand.</em></p>
<p><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">**</span></a></p>
<p><em>The following conferences were granted funding in the 2012 calendar year:</em></p>
<p><a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">**</span></a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><ul>
<li><p>PyCon Australia</p></li>
<li><p>Kiwi PyCon</p></li>
<li><p>PyArgentina</p></li>
<li><p>EuroPython</p></li>
<li><p>PythonBrazil</p></li>
<li><p>PyOhio</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">**</span></a></p>
<p><em>Code of Conduct</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>In keeping up with the current conference scene, the foundation moved to
suggest that all conferences implement a Code of Conduct for their events.
Many conferences have done so on their own, and the foundation agreed that
it’s a good thing for all conferences to have in place.</p>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/12/psf-moves-to-require-code-of-conduct.html">second resolution was passed</a>, making it a requirement that PSF-
funded conferences have a Code of Conduct in place. The foundation wants to
support conferences that support their attendees, so the move was a natural
fit.</p>
<p>Community Service Awards</p>
<p>Each quarter, the foundation selects one or two community members to be
presented with a Community Service Award. The award aims to reward those who
have made substantial contributions to the Python community, with the
recipient receiving a certificate and either a free pass to PyCon or USD $500.</p>
<p>This year’s winners were:</p>
<p>Q1: <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/05/2012-q1-community-service-awards.html">Audrey Roy and Carl
Trachte</a></p>
<p>Q2: Doug Hellmann and Thomas Heller</p>
<p>Q3: <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/10/kenneth-gonsalves-posthumously-awarded.html">Simon Cross  &lt;http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/10/simon-cross-awarded-
community-service.html&gt;`_and `Kenneth
Gonsalves</a></p>
<p>Q4: <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/12/antoine-pitrou-chosen-for-q4-community.html">Antoine Pitrou</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/12/stefan-krah-chosen-for-q4-community.html">Stefan
Krah</a></p>
<p>Distinguished Service Award</p>
<p>Matplotlib’s creator and longtime maintainer, John Hunter, passed away in
August of 2012 after a brief battle with cancer. John’s contributions not only
to Python but to computing, mathematics, and science, have changed the way
people do things. His <a class="reference external" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> project has existed
for over 10 years, initiated during his post-doctoral studies while looking
for alternatives to proprietary products in the same field, and his dedication
to free software never faded throughout his leadership of the project. His
efforts also extended into the recently created <a class="reference external" href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS
Foundation</a>, of which he was a member of the board.</p>
<p>When John passed away, the foundation wanted to do something for John’s
significant achievements, thus the creation of the Distinguished Service Award
and the choosing of him as the first recipient. The award is to be presented
annually to a member of the community who has exhibited long lasting
contributions of high impact, coming with a prize of USD $5,000.</p>
<p>The award was presented to John’s family at a memorial service at his alma
mater, University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Frank Willison Memorial Award</p>
<p>Each year the foundation recommends the recipient of the annual <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/community/awards/frank-willison/">Frank
Willison Memorial Award</a>, an award delivered in conjunction with <a class="reference external" href="http://oreilly.com/">O’Reilly
Media</a> to commemorate O’Reilly’s long time editor-in-
chief and Python fan, Frank Willison, who passed away in 2001.</p>
<p>The 2012 recipient of the award was Jesse Noller, whose outstanding efforts
have reached many areas of the Python community. Jesse began as a CPython
contributor and has since gotten involved in PyCon, acting as the Program
Committee chair in 2010 and 2011, and the conference chair in 2012 and 2013.
His leadership of the 2012 conference lead to the breaking of just about every
record, from sponsorship counts to talk proposals received, on up through
attendance and into revenues. However, Jesse’s efforts extend far beyond
CPython and PyCon, into the creation of many efforts around the Python
community.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>One of the first actions of the year was approval for hardware purchases to
replace an aging python.org infrastructure, thanks to a donation by
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>. Oregon State University’s <a class="reference external" href="http://osuosl.org/">Open Source
Lab</a> offered their services for hosting the new hardware,
and for their services and commitment to open source, a donation of $3000 was
made to them.</p>
<p>A few months later, the purchase of a long-term storage array was approved for
use by the PSF and the Django Software Foundation, to be maintained by long-
time PyCon video coordinator, Carl Karsten. Carl stores several terabytes of
conference video from events such as PyCon, PyOhio, PyTexas, and other events.</p>
<p>Sponsor Members</p>
<p>While the foundation is made up mostly of individual members, sponsor members
are a class of membership for organizations who make a yearly contribution to
the foundation. Like any other members, sponsor members are put before the
current membership for election, after being recommended to the membership by
the board of directors.</p>
<p>2012 saw four organizations recommended and then approved by the membership:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://lincolnloop.com/">Lincoln Loop</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.hood.de/">Hood Media GmbH</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.globo.com/">Globo.com</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Event Coordinator and Secretary</p>
<p>As the conference landscape has grown, not just with PyCon, the foundation’s
largest event, but with events around the globe, the need arose for a
dedicated employee to organize and work with the existing volunteers. Ewa
Jodlowska, who formerly worked with a conference organization company, was
hired to manage the logistics of a conference the size of PyCon and to assist
the chairman in ensuring a successful and smooth event.</p>
<p>After a few months in this position, Ewa expanded her role to include
secretarial duties for the foundation.</p>
<p>Conference Kits</p>
<p>As the foundation found itself sponsoring plenty of conferences this year,
many which include booth space in an expo hall, several “conference kits” were
purchased that could be sent around the world and used by members at the
conference to represent the foundation. So far the kits have made their way to
a few conferences since their purchase. If you see one at a conference near
you, stop by and say hello!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://i.imgur.com/ndVhW.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/ndVhW.jpg</a></p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>The foundation has long held an open call for grant requests, and this year
three were approved.</p>
<p>In April, the board approved a USD $5,000 request from Armin Rigo of the PyPy
team for work on their Software Transactional Memory project. October saw the
passing of a USD $5,000 grant to the developers of Kivy, a multi-touch
framework, to assist in their efforts to port the project to Python 3. Also on
the topic of Python 3 porting was a USD $1,000 grant for Mikhail Korobov to
work with NLTK maintainer Steven Bird to complete their port of the library.</p>
<p>For more information about the foundation’s grant program, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/grants/">http://www.python.org/psf/grants/</a>.</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi</p>
<p>In April a resolution was passed that the foundation would purchase 50
Raspberry Pi devices, to use as raffle prizes, to give to interested projects,
and for other uses to allow the device to see wider use in the hands of Python
users. Several have been given away, including most recently that one will be
added to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.snakebite.net/">Snakebite</a> testing environment, which
will then be added to <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.python.org/2012/12/pandaboard-raspberry-pi-coming-to.html">CPython’s buildbot
fleet</a>.</p>
<p>New Website</p>
<p>After a request for proposal period over the summer, a redesign committee
deliberated over the selections and suggested to the foundation’s board a
combination bid between <a class="reference external" href="http://www.revsys.com/">Revolution Systems</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.projectevolution.com/">Project
Evolution</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.divio.ch/">Divio</a> to design and implement a new python.org. Work
is currently underway, and Jesse Noller wrote about <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2012/11/pythonorg-is-getting-makeover.html">the project’s
progress</a> on November 28.</p>
<p>The redesign project was a long time in the making, and the RFP process went
smoothly. The progress we’re seeing so far has been excellent and we’re
looking forward to presenting the finished project.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great year, and we’re looking forward to an even better
2013. You can make it even better by making a contribution to the foundation
