<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Technology</p></li>
<li><p>An active community.</p></li>

<p>The primary need for a successful community is a good contributor base. The
contributors are our real heroes, who work persistently, on many (if not most)
occasions without any financial benefits, just for the love of the community.
The Python Community is blessed with many such heroes. The PSF’s quarterly
Community Service Award honors these heroes for their notable contributions
and dedication to the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>The PSF is delighted to give the 2016 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/community/awards/psf-awards/#october-2016">Third Quarter Community Service
Award</a> to

Will Kahn-Greene Taken by Erik Rose, June 2016</p>
<p>The PSF funds a variety of conferences and workshops throughout the year
worldwide to educate people about Python. But, not everyone can attend all of
these events. Two people, Sheila Miguez and Will Kahn-Greene wanted to resolve
this problem for the Pythonistas. Will came up with a brilliant idea of
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyvideo.org/">PyVideo</a> and Sheila later joined the mission. PyVideo
works as the warehouse of videos from Python conferences, local user groups,
screencasts, and tutorials.</p>
<p><em>The Dawn of PyVideo</em>
*
*</p>
<p>Back in 2010, Will started a Python video site using the Miro Community video-
sharing platform. PSF encouraged his work with an <a class="reference external" href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/funding-python-miro-community.html">$1800 grant the following
year</a>.
As Will recalls, “I was thinking there were a bunch of Python conferences
putting out video, but they were hosting the videos in different places.
Search engines weren’t really finding it. It was hard to find things even if
you knew where to look.” He started with Miro Community, and later wrote a
whole new codebase for generating the data and another codebase for the front
end of the website.</p>
<p>With these tools he started PyVideo.org. “This new infrastructure let me build
a site closer to what I was envisioning.”</p>
<p>When Sheila joined the project she contributed both to its technology and by
helping the community find Python videos easier. Originally, she intended to
only work on the codebase, but found herself dedicating a lot of time to
adding content to the site.</p>
<p><em>What is PyVideo?</em></p>
<p>PyVideo is a repository that indexes and links to thousands of Python videos.
It also provides a website pyvideo.org where people can browse the collection,
which is more than 5000 Python videos and growing. The goals for PyVideo are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Help people get to Python presentations easier and faster</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on education</p></li>
<li><p>Data collection and categorization.</p></li>
<li><p>Aim to give people an easy, enjoyable experience contributing to open source on PyVideo’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyvideo/pyvideo">GitHub repo</a></p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>The Community Response</em>
*
*</p>
<p>The Python community has welcomed Will and Sheila’s noble endeavor
enthusiastically. Pythonistas around the world never have to miss another
recorded talk or tutorial. Sheila and Will worked relentlessly to give shape
to their mammoth task. When I asked Will about the community’s response, he
said, “Many learned Python by watching videos they found on pyvideo.org. Many
had ideas for different things we could do with the site and other related
projects. I talked with some folks who later contributed fixes and corrections
to the data.”</p>
<p>Will and Sheila worked on pyvideo.org only in their spare time, but it has
became a major catalyst in the growth of the Python community worldwide.
According to Will, pyvideo.org has additional, under publicized benefits:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>PyVideo is a primary source to survey diversity trends among Python conference speakers around the globe.</p></li>
<li><p>Since its videos are solely Python, it is easily searchable and provides more helpful results than other search engines.</p></li>
<li><p>It offers a preview of conferences: By watching past talks people can choose if they want to go.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>PyVideo : The End?</em>
*
*</p>
<p>With a <a class="reference external" href="http://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/pyvideo/status_20160115.html">blog
post</a> Will and
Sheila announced the end of pyvideo.org. “I’m pretty tired of working on
pyvideo and I haven’t had the time or energy to do much on it in a while,”
Will wrote.</p>
<p>Though they were shutting down the site, they never wanted to lose or waste
the valuable data. Will says, “In February 2016 or so, Sheila and I talked
about the state of things and I just felt bad about everything. So we decided
to focus on extracting the data from PyVideo and make sure that even if the
site didn’t live on, the data did. We wrote a bunch of tools and</p>
<p>infrastructure for a community of people to add to, improve and otherwise work
on the data. We figured someone could take the data and build a static site
around it.” Will did a <a class="reference external" href="http://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/pyvideo/status_20160316.html">blog
post</a> about the
status of the data of pyvideo.org, and invited new maintainers to replace the
site.</p>
<p>The end of pyvideo.org broke the hearts of many Pythonistas, including <a class="reference external" href="http://plog.logston.me/">Paul
Logston</a>. Paul’s mornings used to begin by watching a
talk on the site, and he couldn’t renounce his morning entertainment.  He
resolved to replace pyvideo.org. To begin, he wrote his project called
“PyTube” for storing videos. Though initially his interest was personal, its
educational outreach aspect drove him to finish and publicize the project.
Sheila remembers noticing Paul for the first time when she noticed his fork of
the pyvideo data repository. She was excited to see that he’d already built a
static site generator based on PyVideo data. She read Paul’s <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyvideo/pyvideo/wiki/Development-Philosophy">development
philosophy</a>
and felt he was the right person to carry on the mission.</p>
<p>In May 2016, at PyCon US,  there was a lightning talk on PyVideo and its
situation. Paul met some fellow PyVideo followers who, just like him, did not
want to lose the site. They decided to work on it during the Sprints. Though
the structure of the website was ready, there were a lot of things that needed
to be done like data gathering, curating data, and the design of the website.
So, the contributors divided the works between them.</p>
<p>Both Sheila and Will were committed to PyVideo’s continued benefit for the
community, while passing PyVideo to new hands. They were satisfied by Paul’s
work and transferred the domain to his control. Paul’s PyTube code became the
replacement of pyvideo.org on August 13, 2016.</p>
<p><em>Emergence of the Successor : The Present Status
of`PyVideo &lt;https://github.com/pyvideo/pyvideo&gt;`_</em></p>
<p>Now the project has 30 contributors, with Paul serving as project lead. These
contributors have kept the mission alive. Though PyVideo’s aim is still the
same, there is a difference in its technology. The old Django app is replaced
with a static site generated with Pelican, and it now has a separate
repository for data in JSON files. The team’s current work emphasizes making
the project hassle-free to maintain.</p>
<p>Listen to Paul talking about PyVideo and its future on <a class="reference external" href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/83/python-videos-on-demand-at-pyvideo">Talk Python to
Me</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Wings to Fly</em>
*
*</p>
<p>Every community needs someone with a vision for its future. Will and Sheila
had showed us a path to grow and help the community. It is now our
responsibility to take the new PyVideo further. Paul describes its purpose
beautifully: “PyVideo’s deeper ‘why’ is the desire to make educating oneself
as easy, affordable, and available as possible.” Contributors: please come and
join the project, give a hand to Paul and the team to help move this great
endeavor forward.</p>
