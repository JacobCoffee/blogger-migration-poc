<h1>“Weapons of Math Destruction” by Cathy O’Neil<a class="headerlink" href="#weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy-o-neil" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger</em> <a class="reference external" href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/01/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-cathy.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a 1947 lecture on computing machinery, Alan Turing made a prediction: “The
new machines will in no way replace thought, but rather they will increase the
need for it.”</p>
<p>Someday, he said, machines would think for themselves, but the computers of
the near future would require human supervision to prevent malfunctions:</p>
<p>&gt; “The intention in constructing these machines in the first instance is to
&gt; treat them as slaves, giving them only jobs which have been thought out in
&gt; detail, jobs such that the user of the machine fully understands in
&gt; principle what is going on all the time.”
&gt; <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`1 &lt;http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/01/weapons-of-math-destruction-by-
&gt; cathy.html#1&gt;`_</span></a></p>
<p>It is unclear now whether machines remain slaves, or if they are beginning to
be masters. Machine-learning algorithms pervasively control the lives of
Americans. We do not fully understand what they do, and when they malfunction
they harm us, by reinforcing the unjust systems we already have. Usually
unintentionally, they can make the lives of poor people and people of color
worse.</p>
<p>In “Weapons of Math Destruction”, Cathy O’Neil identifies such an algorithm as
a “WMD” if it satisfies three criteria: it makes decisions of consequence for
a large number of people, it is opaque and unaccountable, and it is
destructive. I interviewed O’Neil to learn what data scientists should do to
disarm these weapons.</p>
<section id="automated-injustice">
<h2>Automated Injustice<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-injustice" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recidivism risk models are a striking example of algorithms that reinforce
injustice. These algorithms purport to predict how likely a convict is to
commit another crime in the next few years. The model described in O’Neil’s
book, called
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&amp;id=overview&amp;prod=lsi-r">LSI-R</a>,
assesses offenders with 54 questions, then produces a risk score based on
correlations between each offender’s characteristics and the characteristics
of recidivists and non-recidivists in a sample population of offenders.</p>
<p>Some of LSI-R’s factors measure the offender’s past behavior: Has she ever
been expelled from school, or violated parole? But most factors probably
aren’t under the individual’s control: Does she live in a high-crime
neighborhood? Is she poor? And many factors are not under her control at all:
Has a family member been convicted of any crimes? Did her parents raise her
with a “rewarding” parenting style?</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKu6FMXYZLklcVS19XECCM5_C7jSOgWavAPk2ENdTOCKIwJtH3SCK_K7FkgEO5ujMlW9hLBhQGFwQb4JdCGeViWCvuipVTFQQb-CIExl0EyIN5t-6rj_UjuHQtazUOhIEMOA/s200/weaponsmath-r4-6-06.jpg">![</a>](<a class="reference external" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKu6FMXYZLklcVS19XECCM5_C7jSOgWavAPk2ENdTOCKIwJtH3SCK_K7FkgEO5ujMlW9hLBhQGFwQb4JdCGeViWCvuipVTFQQb">https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKu6FMXYZLklcVS19XECCM5_C7jSOgWavAPk2ENdTOCKIwJtH3SCK_K7FkgEO5ujMlW9hLBhQGFwQb4JdCGeViWCvuipVTFQQb</a>-

<p>Studies of LSI-R show it gives worse scores to poor black people. Some of its
questions directly measure poverty, and others (such as frequently changing
residence) are proxies for poverty. LSI-R does not know the offender’s race.
It would be illegal to ask, but, O’Neil writes, “with the wealth of detail
each prisoner provides, that single illegal question is almost superfluous.”
For example, it asks the offender’s age when he was first involved with the
police. O’Neil cites a 2013 New York Civil Liberties Union study that young
black and Hispanic men were ten times as likely to be stopped by the New York
City police, even though only a tiny fraction were doing anything criminal.</p>
<p>So far, the LSI-R does not automatically become destructive. If it is
accurate, and used for benign choices like spending more time treating and
counselling offenders with high risk scores, it could do some good. But in
many states, judges use the LSI-R and models like it to decide how long the
offender’s sentence should be. <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wilentz.com/criminallaw/2015/04/15/the-use-and-abuse-of-the-lsi-r-in-parole-evaluations-challenging-so-called-objective-testing/">This is not LSI-R’s intended
use</a>, and it
is certainly not accurate enough for it: a study this year found that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23774657.2015.1111743">LSI-R
misclassified 41% of
offenders</a>.

<section id="success-according-to-whom">
<h2>Success, According to Whom?<a class="headerlink" href="#success-according-to-whom" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>O’Neil told me that whether an algorithm becomes a WMD depends on who defines
success, and according to whom. “Over and over again, people act as if there’s
only one set of stakeholders.”</p>
<p>When a recidivism risk model is used to sentence someone to a longer prison
term, the sole stakeholder respected is law enforcement. “Law enforcement
cares more about true positives, correctly identifying someone who will
reoffend and putting them in jail for longer to keep them from committing
another crime.” But our society has a powerful interest in preventing false
positives. Indeed, we were founded on a constitution that considered a false
positive—that is, being punished for a crime you did not commit—to be
extremely costly. Principles including the presumption of innocence, the
requirement that guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt, and so on, express
our desire to avoid unjust punishment, even at the cost of some criminals
being punished too little or going free.</p>
<p>However, this interest is ignored when an offender is punished for a bad LSI-R
score. His total sentence accounts not only for the crime he committed, but
also for future crimes he is thought likely to commit. Furthermore, he is
punished for who he is: Being related to a criminal or being raised badly are
circumstances of birth, but for many people facing sentencing, such
circumstances are used to add years to their time behind bars.</p>
</section>
<section id="statistically-unsound">
<h2>Statistically Unsound<a class="headerlink" href="#statistically-unsound" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cathy O’Neil says weapons of math destruction are usually caused by two
failures. The first is when only one stakeholder’s interests define success.
LSI-R is an example of this. The other is a lack of actual science in data
science. For these algorithms, she told me, “We actually don’t have reasonable
ways of checking to see whether something is working or not.”</p>
<p>A New York City public school program begun in 2007 assessed teachers with a
“value added model”, which estimated how much a teacher affected each
student’s progress on standardized tests. To begin, the model forecast
students’ progress, given their neighborhood, family income, previous
achievement, and so on. At the end of the year their actual progress was
compared to the forecast, and the difference was attributed to the teacher’s
effectiveness. O’Neil tells the story of Tim Clifford, a public school teacher
who scored only 6 out of 100 the first year he was assessed, then 96 out of
100 the next year. O’Neil writes, “Attempting to score a teacher’s
effectiveness by analyzing the test results of only twenty-five or thirty
students is statistically unsound, even laughable.” One analysis of the
assessment showed that <a class="reference external" href="http://garyrubinstein.teachforus.org/2012/02/26/analyzing-released-nyc-value-added-data-part-1/">a quarter of teachers’ scores swung by 40 points in a
year</a>. Another showed that, with such small samples, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/27/nyregion/27teachers.html">the
margin of error made half of all teachers statistically
indistinguishable</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the score might determine if the teacher was given a bonus, or
fired. Although its decision was probabilistic, appealing it required
conclusive evidence. O’Neil points out that time and again, “the human victims
of WMDs are held to a higher standard of evidence than the algorithms
themselves.” The model is math so it is presumed correct, and anyone who
objects to its scores is suspect.</p>
<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo put a moratorium on these teacher evaluations
in 2015. We are starting to see that some questions require too subtle an
intelligence for our current algorithms to answer accurately. As Alan Turing
said, “If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be
intelligent.”</p>
</section>
<section id="responsible-data-science">
<h2>Responsible Data Science<a class="headerlink" href="#responsible-data-science" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>I asked Cathy O’Neil about the responsibilities of data scientists, both in
their daily work and as reformers of their profession. Regarding daily work,
O’Neil drew a sharp line: “I don’t want data scientists to be de facto policy
makers.” Rather, their job is to explain to policy makers the moral tradeoffs
of their choices. The same as any programmer gathers requirements before
coding a solution, data scientists should gather requirements regarding the
relative cost of different kinds of errors. Machine learning algorithms are
always imperfect, but they can be tweaked for either more false positives or
more false negatives. When the stakes are high, the choice between the two is
a moral one. Data scientists must pose these questions frankly to policy
makers, says O’Neil, and “translate moral decisions into code.”</p>
<p>Tradeoffs in the private sector often pit corporate interests against human
ones. This is especially dangerous to the poor because, as O’Neil writes, “The
privileged are processed more by people, the masses by machines.” She told me
that when the boss asks for an algorithm that optimizes for profit, it is the
data scientist’s duty to mention that the algorithm should also consider
fairness.</p>
<p>“Weapons of Math Destruction” tells us how to recognize a WMD once it is
built. But how can we predict whether an algorithm will become a WMD? O’Neil
told me, “The biggest warning sign is if you’re choosing winners and losers,
and if it’s a big deal for losers to lose. If it’s an important decision and
it’s a secret formula, then that’s a set-up for a weapon of math destruction.
The only other ingredient you need in that setup is actually making it
destructive.”</p>
</section>
<section id="reform">
<h2>Reform<a class="headerlink" href="#reform" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cathy O’Neil says the top priority, for data scientists who want to disarm
WMDs, is to develop tools for analyzing them. For example, any EU citizen
harmed by an algorithmic decision may soon have <a class="reference external" href="http://fusion.net/story/321178/european-union-right-to-algorithmic-explanation/">the legal right to an
explanation</a>, but so far we lack the tools to provide one. We
also need tools to measure disparate impact and unfairness. O’Neil says, “We
need tools to decide whether an algorithm is being racist.”</p>
<p>New data scientists should enter the field with better training in ethics.
Curricula usually ignore questions of justice, as if the job of the data
scientist were purely technical. Data-science contests like
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> also encourage this view, says O’Neil.
“Kaggle has defined the success and the penalty function. The hard part of
data science is everything that happens before Kaggle.” O’Neil wants more case
studies from the field, anonymized so students can learn from them how data
science is really practiced. It would be an opportunity to ask: When an
algorithm makes a mistake, who gets hurt?</p>
<p>If data scientists take responsibility for the effects of their work, says
O’Neil, they will become activists. “I’m hoping the book, at the very least,
gets people to acknowledge the power that they’re wielding,” she says, “and
how it could be used for good or bad. The very first thing we have to realize
is that well-intentioned people can make horrible mistakes.”</p>
